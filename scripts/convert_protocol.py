"""Convert the protocol docx to Markdown and verify the result two ways.

    python scripts/convert_protocol.py \

        --out specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.0.md \
        --terminal "Preservation verdict"

Exit 0 = both checks passed and the file was written.
Exit 1 = a check failed; nothing is written.
Exit 2 = could not run.

Why two checks
--------------
Conversion fidelity catches a lossy conversion. It cannot catch a truncated
input, because a faithful conversion of a truncated document passes perfectly.
That is how v1.0 was first committed from a source that stopped mid-row after
V21: the fidelity check was correct and the answer it gave was correct, and the
document was still incomplete. Completeness is a separate question and needs a
separate check.

What each check establishes, and what it does not
-------------------------------------------------
FIDELITY compares the alphanumeric word sequence of the docx against the
Markdown. It establishes that no word was dropped, added or reordered. It does
NOT establish that punctuation, emphasis, or table alignment survived, because
markdown syntax is punctuation and is excluded from the comparison by
construction.

COMPLETENESS establishes that the verification table runs from V01 with strictly
increasing identifiers, no gaps, uniform field count, and that a declared
terminal marker follows the last row. It does NOT establish that the source is
the newest draft, nor that V44 is the correct final row. It establishes that the
document does not stop in the middle of itself.

Neither check establishes that this docx is the document Alex intended to send.
That remains a human confirmation.
