"""A full rehearsal of the protocol, end to end, in a throwaway repository.

    python scripts/dry_run.py
    python scripts/dry_run.py --keep        # leave the directory to inspect

Exit 0 = every step did what the protocol says it should.
Exit 1 = a step did not; the transcript says which and what it printed.

What this is, and what it is not
--------------------------------
Alex Zamurko's sequence puts a full dry run before the first real A.1-E cycle.
This is that: the real commands, in the documented order, against a repository
built for the purpose, printing what an operator would see.

It is not a test suite. The suites ask whether each component refuses what it
should; this asks whether the components compose — whether the thing the runner
freezes is the thing the gate accepts, whether what the ledger records is what
the controller reads, whether the sequence an operator is told to follow gets
from an empty directory to a decision.

**It cannot rehearse the review.** The one step that needs a reviewer is
performed here with a fixture reply written in advance. Every other step is
real. So a clean run says the machinery composes; it says nothing whatever
about whether a review would find anything, and the transcript repeats that at
the end rather than leaving a green result to be read as more than it is.

Nothing outside the temporary directory is touched. It refuses to start if the
path it is given is inside this repository.
