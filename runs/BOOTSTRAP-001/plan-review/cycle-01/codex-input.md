# Bootstrap review prompt

Frozen for the `BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW` of the execution layer. Hand-written, per Alex
Zamurko, 8 September: a hand-written prompt is acceptable for the bootstrap and
the five production prompts are built and frozen before A1E-001.

This is **not** one of the five. It is used once, on the components that had to
exist before the protocol could run at all.

Revised twice, both times before use, and both times because it was written
before the thing it had to describe existed.

- 8 September. The first version named three artifacts. The ledger and loop
  controller were built after it was written, so calling it frozen was premature.
- 9 September. It did not name `scripts/bootstrap_gate.py`, the gate that now
  blocks every real cycle, and it predated Alex Zamurko's section mapping of the
  review scope. Both are below.

Nothing has been reviewed against any earlier text.

---

## What you are reviewing

Six artifacts, hashed and listed in `target.json`:

```text
specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md   the frozen evidence structure
scripts/validate_cycle.py       the MC-2 conformance gate, fifteen checks
scripts/run_review.py           the review runner
scripts/ledger.py               the finding and state ledger
scripts/loop_state.py           the loop-state controller
scripts/bootstrap_gate.py       the gate enforcing this review
```

Their negative-control suites are supplied alongside as evidence that the checks
they contain are falsifiable:

```text
scripts/test_validate_cycle.py   24 controls
scripts/test_run_review.py       26 controls
scripts/test_ledger.py           37 controls, covering the ledger and controller
scripts/test_bootstrap_gate.py   24 controls
scripts/test_interfaces.py       12 controls, across six component seams
```

Those counts are asserted here and checked by `scripts/test_prompts.py` against
the suites themselves. A count typed into a prompt is a count that drifts, and
an inflated one would misrepresent how well controlled these components are to
the reviewer being asked to trust them.

## What you are reviewing them against

The protocol at the commit and hash recorded in `target.json`. That file is
authoritative for this review. Where this prompt and the protocol disagree, the
protocol governs and the disagreement is itself a finding.

Alex Zamurko fixed the scope on 9 September, and it maps directly rather than
being left to your judgement:

```text
scripts/validate_cycle.py   MC-2, and §10.2 for implementation review
scripts/run_review.py       §2.2 input composition, §10.1 target fields
scripts/ledger.py           §§5 and 12
scripts/loop_state.py       §§6 and 13
scripts/bootstrap_gate.py   no protocol section; see below
```

His reason for including the last two, in his words: they "determine the
authoritative meaning of otherwise valid review evidence", finding state and loop
outcome. An error there produces a false process outcome from evidence that
passes MC-2 cleanly.

`bootstrap_gate.py` implements no protocol section. It implements his ruling of
8 September that this review is mandatory before any real cycle. Review it
against that ruling and against whether it can be circumvented: it is the single
boolean standing between development evidence and a live protocol run, and it
covers itself in its own hash set precisely because an earlier version did not.

## The question

Do these five artifacts implement §2.2, §5, §6, §10.1, §10.2, MC-1 and MC-2 as
written, and do their controls actually establish what they claim?

Two failure modes matter more than the rest.

**A check that cannot come back false.** The v1.0 gate-hardening milestone found
thirteen of these. A check whose failure branch is unreachable reports success
while testing nothing. For every check in `validate_cycle.py` and every refusal
in `run_review.py`, ask whether the supplied controls demonstrate it firing, or
whether the control merely exercises the same code path under a different name.
Checks 1 to 4 are one mechanism, file existence, and only check 4 is
demonstrated; that specific weakness is already known and does not need
reporting, but comparable cases elsewhere do.

**A claim stronger than its evidence.** `MC1_ENFORCEMENT` is
`CONVENTION_ONLY` on this environment. Flag any language in the schema, the
scripts or their documentation that implies technical protection, immutability,
or a proven binding between reviewer input and reviewer output.

## Decisions already declared

The protocol underdetermines these, and each was resolved to build at all. They
are disclosed so you assess them rather than rediscover them. Undeclared
deviations you find are ordinary findings.

```text
A  target is instantiated on disk as target.json, and DIFF_HASH and
   TEST_RESULT_HASH are paired with diff_path and test_result_path so
   checks 14 and 15 have an artifact to hash. Ruled a schema-level
   concretisation, not a protocol change. See evidence-schema-v1.0.md.

B  candidate_tree_hash is derived by the runner from candidate_commit and
   never supplied by the operator. A hand-typed tree hash can be typed to
   match whatever was recorded.

C  Checks 11 to 15 report N/A on a plan cycle, never PASS. §10.2 scopes them
   to implementation review, and reporting PASS for a check that was never
   evaluated is the defect this gate exists to catch.

D  ACCEPT records a disposition and leaves the finding OPEN. §5 gives
   RESOLVED only "once the repair is demonstrated in the next review
   target", so ledger.py refuses to resolve in the same cycle as the
   acceptance. The protocol does not say who declares a repair demonstrated;
   `resolve` requires an evidence string rather than inventing an answer.

E  DISPUTED is terminal in the automated loop. §5 and §7.1 place adjudication
   at the human gate, so nothing here moves a finding out of it.

F  Check 13 compares approved_plan_hash against
   plan-approval/approval.json, where §7.3 freezes it. Absent that record the
   check fails rather than passing vacuously.

G  loop_state.py runs the MC-2 gate itself rather than reading a recorded
   verdict, so §6's n indexes VALID cycles and events recorded in an invalid
   cycle are ignored entirely, including resolutions. This is the
   conservative reading: it can delay an exit, never manufacture one.
```

D and G are the two most worth arguing with. D decides when a finding stops
being open, and G decides what counts as a cycle at all.

## Output format

Use only this closed vocabulary:

```text
MISSING REQUIREMENT
WRONG OWNERSHIP
NONDETERMINISTIC WHERE D POSSIBLE
SEMANTIC STEP TOO BROAD
UNTESTED RULE
CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING
```

One block per finding, persistent identifier, cycle 01:

```text
Finding ID: B01-F01
Class:
Artifact:
Location:
Evidence:
Finding:
Required correction:
```

Quote the `TARGET_SHA256` from the top of this input in your first line, so the
response is bound to the exact artifacts you were shown.

If you find nothing in a category, say so explicitly rather than omitting it.
An empty review is a finding about the review, not about the code.

## Scope limits

Out of scope: style, performance, and anything in `specs/gap/`. Naming is out of
scope except where decision A is wrong.

Not yet built, so their absence is not a finding: the five production prompts,
the human review package generator (§7), and the Gold runner (§15). The
implementing agent has not written a plan or an implementation yet, so there is
no A1E-001 evidence to review; this is the tooling only.

# The governing protocol

`specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.1.md`, sha256 `296594a3c06cd2f9c66976c369b15804f39bbb2be37b5e62234d37fafd28d483`.

This is the document the artifacts below are reviewed against. Where
it and the review prompt disagree, this governs.

```
Claude–Codex Minimal Implementation and Review Workflow
0. Protocol governance and baseline
0.1 Governing protocol
This workflow is a version-controlled governing specification.
Before any implementation run begins, the authoritative protocol must itself be committed to git.
Recommended location:
specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.1.md

Record:
PROTOCOL_PATH
PROTOCOL_VERSION
PROTOCOL_COMMIT
PROTOCOL_HASH

The authoritative protocol is the git-controlled artifact.
Slack, chat history, .docx drafts, or other transient communication channels are not authoritative copies.
Every implementation run must reference the exact protocol version, commit, and hash used.
No implementation run may begin until these fields are populated.

0.2 Freeze the specification and baseline
Record:
SPEC_PATH
SPEC_VERSION
SPEC_HASH

BASELINE_COMMIT
BASELINE_TEST_RESULT
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT
GOLD_SET_VERSION
GOLD_SET_HASH

If no executable implementation exists yet:
BASELINE_COMMIT: NONE
BASELINE_TEST_RESULT: NOT_APPLICABLE
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT: NOT_APPLICABLE
REASON: no executable baseline implementation

A baseline result must never be manufactured retrospectively.
Where an executable baseline exists, the frozen Gold Set must be run before implementation.

1. Claude audits frozen spec → current code
Claude audits every implementable requirement in the frozen specification against the current implementation.
Each requirement receives exactly one disposition:
DONE
PARTIAL
MISSING
CONFLICT

Claude produces:
SPEC → CODE → TEST mapping

For each requirement:
Requirement ID:
Spec location:
Normative requirement:

Disposition:
DONE | PARTIAL | MISSING | CONFLICT

Current code:
Current tests:

Required implementation delta:
Required deterministic/conformance test:
Dependencies/blockers:

Claude then produces a bounded implementation plan containing only changes justified by the audit.
No implementation occurs at this stage.

2. Plan review loop — Claude ↔ Codex
Maximum:
4 VALID CODEX REVIEW CYCLES

Only cycles that pass the MC-2 conformance gate count toward this maximum.

2.1 Freeze the review target for every cycle
Every cycle receives its own directory.
Example:
plan-review/
cycle-01/
cycle-02/
cycle-03/
cycle-04/

Before Codex review:
target
target.sha256

must be created.
target identifies or contains the exact plan artifact to be reviewed in that cycle.
A repaired plan creates a new target and therefore a new review cycle.

2.2 Review runner composes the Codex input
The implementing agent does not construct or supply the authoritative Codex review input.
The review runner:
reads the frozen target;
calculates/verifies target.sha256;
composes codex-input.md;
includes the exact target SHA-256 verbatim in codex-input.md;
supplies the frozen target or its exact referenced content to Codex;
writes the resulting Codex output to the review evidence directory.
Required relationship:
target
↓
review runner
↓
codex-input.md
↓
Codex
↓
codex-output-raw.md

The implementing agent may trigger the review process but may not alter the authoritative codex-input.md after composition.

3. Mandatory controls for every Codex review cycle
MC-1 — Reviewer input/output boundary
Codex review evidence must be technically separated from the implementing agent where infrastructure permits.
The review runner owns creation of:
target.sha256
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md
findings.json

After capture:
Claude / implementing agent:

READ:
permitted where required

WRITE:
denied

DELETE:
denied

for authoritative review evidence.
Claude may write separately:
claude-response.md
repaired-target

Claude may not overwrite:
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md
findings.json

Input-side control
The review runner, not Claude, composes codex-input.md from the frozen target.
Therefore the implementing agent does not control either:
what authoritative artifact Codex is shown
or
what authoritative Codex response is retained

Enforcement status
Each run records:
MC1_ENFORCEMENT:
TECHNICALLY_ENFORCED
or
CONVENTION_ONLY

If infrastructure cannot enforce write/delete restrictions:
MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY

must be recorded.
In that case, claims such as:
Codex findings are immutable
review input is technically protected

must not be made.
The protocol then provides procedural discipline, not a technical guarantee.

MC-2 — Per-cycle evidence completeness and target-binding gate
Every completed review cycle must contain:
target
target.sha256
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md

A deterministic conformance check must verify:
1. target exists

2. target.sha256 exists

3. codex-input.md exists

4. codex-output-raw.md exists

5. all required files are non-empty

6. SHA256(target)
==
value recorded in target.sha256

7. cycle identifier is unique

8. where target references a git commit:
referenced commit exists

9. all mandatory hashed artifacts for that review type
are present and their recorded hashes match the referenced artifacts

10. codex-input.md contains the exact target SHA-256 verbatim

Check 10 creates the required binding:
frozen target
↕
target SHA-256
↕
actual Codex input

A review is therefore not valid merely because a frozen artifact and a Codex response both exist. The recorded input must demonstrably reference the exact frozen target.
Result:
MC2_CONFORMANCE:
PASS | FAIL

If:
MC2_CONFORMANCE = FAIL

then:
REVIEW_CYCLE_STATUS = INVALID

An invalid cycle:
cannot support an authoritative Codex finding;
cannot count toward CONVERGED;
cannot count toward HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED;
cannot count toward STALLED;
cannot count toward MAX_4_REACHED;
cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles.
The evidence failure must be corrected and the review rerun.

MC-3 — Gold Set performance is comparative where a baseline exists
Where executable baseline code exists, preserve Gold Set results:
BEFORE implementation
AND
AFTER final implementation

using the same frozen Gold Set version/hash.
Where no executable baseline exists:
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT = NOT_APPLICABLE

and the candidate is evaluated against predefined Gold acceptance criteria.

4. Codex reviews the implementation plan
Codex reviews the exact frozen plan against the frozen specification.
Codex uses the following closed finding vocabulary:
MISSING REQUIREMENT

WRONG OWNERSHIP

NONDETERMINISTIC WHERE D POSSIBLE

SEMANTIC STEP TOO BROAD

UNTESTED RULE

CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

Every finding receives a persistent identifier.
Example:
Finding ID: C02-F03
Class: UNTESTED RULE
Requirement ID: R-B7
Evidence:
Finding:
Required correction:

The vocabulary remains unchanged across cycles so that finding sets remain comparable.
The raw Codex response is captured before summarisation, interpretation, or Claude response.

5. Claude responds to Codex findings
Claude must respond to every finding with exactly one disposition:
ACCEPT

or:
REJECT_WITH_REASON

ACCEPT
Claude accepts the finding and repairs the plan.
The original Codex finding remains unchanged in the authoritative review record.
Its state becomes:
RESOLVED

once the repair is demonstrated in the next review target.

REJECT_WITH_REASON
Claude records:
Finding ID:
Disposition: REJECT_WITH_REASON
Reason:
Spec evidence:

Claude does not erase, rewrite, or close the Codex finding.
Its state becomes:
DISPUTED

and requires human adjudication.

6. Mechanically determine the plan-loop state
For each valid cycle, every Codex finding has one current state:
OPEN
RESOLVED
DISPUTED

Define:
OPEN_n
= set of actionable OPEN finding IDs after cycle n

RESOLVED_NEW_n
= findings that were OPEN after cycle n-1
and became RESOLVED during cycle n

DISPUTED_NEW_n
= findings that were OPEN after cycle n-1
and became DISPUTED during cycle n

For cycle n > 1, progress exists iff:
|OPEN_n| < |OPEN_n-1|

OR

RESOLVED_NEW_n is non-empty

OR

DISPUTED_NEW_n is non-empty

A newly recorded dispute counts as progress because an unresolved finding has been converted into an explicit human-adjudication issue.
Merely re-raising an already existing dispute does not count as progress.

Exit A — CONVERGED
OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n = ∅

Stop the automated plan loop.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = CONVERGED

Exit B — HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n ≠ ∅

All actionable findings have been resolved or converted into disputes, and no further automated repair is available.
Stop the automated plan loop immediately.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED

Exit C — STALLED
For any valid cycle n > 1:
STALLED
IFF

|OPEN_n| >= |OPEN_n-1|

AND

RESOLVED_NEW_n = ∅

AND

DISPUTED_NEW_n = ∅

The immediately preceding valid cycle therefore produced:
no reduction in open actionable findings;
no newly resolved finding;
no newly disputed finding.
Stop the automated loop immediately.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = STALLED

Exit D — MAX_4_REACHED
If:
VALID_CYCLE_COUNT = 4

and none of CONVERGED, HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED, or an earlier STALLED exit occurred:
LOOP_STATUS = MAX_4_REACHED

Stop automated review.

Otherwise — CONTINUE
If:
not CONVERGED
not HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
not STALLED
VALID_CYCLE_COUNT < 4

Claude repairs the plan.
A new plan version is produced.
Return to Step 2 and create a new per-cycle review target.

7. Human review of the implementation plan
Human review occurs after:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
or
MAX_4_REACHED

These states are not equivalent.
The review package must contain:
final plan
final plan hash

loop status
valid iteration count

SPEC → CODE → TEST mapping

resolved findings
disputes
unresolved findings

MC-1 enforcement status
MC-2 conformance results for every valid cycle

7.1 Disputes
A dispute is:
Codex finding
+
Claude REJECT_WITH_REASON

The human adjudicates the dispute.

7.2 Unresolved findings
An unresolved finding remains:
OPEN

The human determines whether it:
requires correction
is explicitly waived/accepted
or
causes rejection of the plan

Disputes and unresolved findings must be presented separately.

7.3 Human decision
Permitted outcomes:
APPROVE
RETURN_FOR_REWORK
REJECT

If approved:
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
APPROVAL_RECORD

are frozen.

8. Claude implements the approved plan
Claude implements only the exact approved plan.
Before Codex implementation review, run:
build/check
deterministic tests
conformance tests
regression tests

Mechanical or deterministic failures return directly to Claude for repair.

9. PLAN_DEVIATION control
A material change outside the approved plan may not be introduced silently.
If implementation requires such a change:
1. STOP implementation.

2. Record:
PLAN_DEVIATION_ID
reason
affected requirement
proposed plan change
affected code/tests

3. Do not implement the deviation.

4. Return to Step 7:
HUMAN REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

5. Human reviews the revised plan.

6. If approved:
freeze new APPROVED_PLAN_HASH.

7. Resume implementation only against the newly approved plan.

Therefore:
MATERIAL PLAN DEVIATION
→ MANDATORY RETURN TO HUMAN PLAN APPROVAL

A deviation cannot be legitimised retrospectively during code review.

10. Implementation review loop — Claude ↔ Codex
Maximum:
4 VALID CODEX REVIEW CYCLES

The same MC-1, MC-2 and loop-state rules apply.
Every cycle receives its own directory:
implementation-review/
cycle-01/
cycle-02/
cycle-03/
cycle-04/

10.1 Freeze the exact implementation target per cycle
For implementation review, the target must identify all of the following:
CANDIDATE_COMMIT
CANDIDATE_TREE_HASH
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
DIFF_HASH
TEST_RESULT_HASH

These fields are mandatory, not conditional.
The target must bind the review to:
exact candidate code
exact approved plan
exact implementation diff
exact deterministic/conformance/regression results

Before Codex review:
target
target.sha256

are frozen.
The review runner then composes:
codex-input.md

from that frozen target and includes target.sha256 verbatim.
After Codex returns:
codex-output-raw.md

is captured before any implementation repair.

10.2 Implementation-specific MC-2 checks
For every implementation review cycle, the conformance gate must additionally and unconditionally verify:
11. candidate commit is present and exists

12. candidate tree hash is present
and matches the candidate tree

13. approved-plan hash is present
and matches the frozen approved plan

14. diff hash is present
and matches the exact reviewed diff

15. test-result hash is present
and matches the exact supplied test results

Failure of any check makes the cycle:
INVALID

and it does not consume the four-cycle budget.

11. Codex reviews the exact implementation
Codex receives:
frozen specification
approved plan
exact candidate commit/hash
exact implementation diff
relevant tests
deterministic/conformance/regression results

The authoritative codex-input.md is composed by the review runner, not by Claude.
Codex uses the same closed finding vocabulary:
MISSING REQUIREMENT
WRONG OWNERSHIP
NONDETERMINISTIC WHERE D POSSIBLE
SEMANTIC STEP TOO BROAD
UNTESTED RULE
CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

The raw review is preserved through MC-1 and MC-2.

12. Claude responds and repairs
For every finding:
ACCEPT
→ repair implementation

or:
REJECT_WITH_REASON
→ preserve as DISPUTED

Claude cannot modify the authoritative Codex evidence where MC-1 is technically enforced.
A repair creates a new candidate and therefore a new review cycle.

13. Determine implementation-loop exit
Use exactly the same mechanically defined states and exit order as the plan loop:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
MAX_4_REACHED
CONTINUE

HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
IFF

OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n ≠ ∅

When this state is reached, stop the automated implementation-review loop immediately and proceed to Step 14 for human adjudication.
No separate or subjective implementation-loop definition is permitted.

14. Human review of final code
Human review occurs after:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
or
MAX_4_REACHED

The review package contains:
frozen specification
approved plan
candidate commit/hash

exact implementation diff
deterministic test results
conformance test results
regression test results

resolved findings
disputes
unresolved findings

loop status
valid iteration count

MC-1 enforcement status
MC-2 result for every valid cycle

any approved plan deviations

Human decision:
APPROVE
RETURN_FOR_REWORK
REJECT

If approved, freeze the exact candidate commit/hash.

15. Gold Set validation
15.1 Existing executable baseline
Run the same frozen Gold Set against:
BASELINE
vs
FINAL CANDIDATE

Compare at minimum:
targeted improvements
previously correct cases retained
new false positives
new false negatives
regressions
aggregate performance

Aggregate improvement does not override an unacceptable regression.

15.2 No executable baseline
Record:
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT = NOT_APPLICABLE

Run the frozen Gold Set against the candidate and evaluate against predefined acceptance criteria.

16. Final freeze / release decision
The release evidence contains:
PROTOCOL_PATH
PROTOCOL_VERSION
PROTOCOL_COMMIT
PROTOCOL_HASH

SPEC_VERSION
SPEC_HASH

APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
FINAL_CANDIDATE_COMMIT
FINAL_CANDIDATE_HASH

PLAN_LOOP_STATUS
IMPLEMENTATION_LOOP_STATUS

MC1_ENFORCEMENT
MC2_CONFORMANCE_RESULTS

DISPUTE DISPOSITIONS
UNRESOLVED-FINDING DISPOSITIONS

BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT
FINAL_GOLD_RESULT
GOLD_COMPARISON

FINAL HUMAN DECISION

Only then is the capability frozen/released.

Minimal execution view
0. PROTOCOL + BASELINE
Commit/version protocol in git.
Record protocol path/version/commit/hash.
Freeze spec.
Freeze existing baseline tests + Gold.
If no executable baseline → mark N/A.

1. CLAUDE AUDIT + PLAN
DONE / PARTIAL / MISSING / CONFLICT
SPEC → CODE → TEST

deterministic/conformance tests

2. PLAN REVIEW LOOP

embeds target SHA-256 in input

capture raw Codex output

Codex reviews with closed finding vocabulary

Claude:

REJECT_WITH_REASON → DISPUTED

Mechanical exit:

MAX 4 valid cycles

3. HUMAN PLAN REVIEW
separately review:
disputes
unresolved findings

approve / return / reject
freeze approved plan

4. CLAUDE IMPLEMENTS

MATERIAL PLAN DEVIATION

5. CODE REVIEW LOOP
EACH cycle:

# Artifacts under review

## `specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md`

`sha256 98a5920def59c39dc5c8bdbb5700376e21560ee40654173219a5ac0bef246379`

```
# Review evidence schema v1.0

Frozen structure for review-cycle evidence under the implementation and review
protocol. MC-2 checks evidence against this schema, so the schema must be frozen
before any cycle is written: a checker cannot validate a structure that is still
moving.

Derived against the protocol source containing §2.2 and §10.2, which specifies
**fifteen** MC-2 checks — 1 to 10 for every cycle, 11 to 15 additionally and
unconditionally for implementation review.

## Status of this document

```text
MC1_ENFORCEMENT   CONVENTION_ONLY
```

Decided before Run 1 rather than discovered during it. The implementing agent
and the review evidence share one effective write authority on the current
single-user Windows environment, so a technical immutability claim is not
supportable. Per MC-1, claims that Codex findings are immutable or that review
input is technically protected **must not be made** while this holds.

Upgrade to `TECHNICALLY_ENFORCED` only when authoritative review evidence sits
behind a write boundary the implementing agent does not have.

## Directory layout

    implementation-review/
      cycle-01/
        ...
    code-approval/
    gold/
```

Cycle directories are `cycle-NN`, zero-padded, starting at `01`. The number is
the cycle identifier and must be unique within its review directory.

## `target.json`

The frozen artifact identity for one cycle. Hashed as a file; that hash is what
binds the cycle together.

Common fields, both review types:

```json
{
  "review_type": "plan" | "implementation",
  "run_id": "A1E-001",
  "cycle": 1,
  "protocol_commit": "…",
  "protocol_sha256": "…",
  "spec_sha256": "…",
  "frozen_at": "2026-09-08T13:40:00Z"
}
```

Plan review adds:

```json
{
  "plan_files": [
    { "path": "runs/A1E-001/plan/01-PLAN.md", "sha256": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Implementation review adds the §10.1 fields. All five are mandatory, not
conditional:

```json
{
  "candidate_commit":    "…",
  "candidate_tree_hash": "…",
  "approved_plan_hash":  "…",
  "diff_path":           "…",
  "diff_hash":           "…",
  "test_result_path":    "…",
  "test_result_hash":    "…"
}
```

`candidate_tree_hash` is derived by the runner from `candidate_commit`, never
supplied by hand. A tree hash typed in by an operator is a tree hash that can be
typed to match whatever was recorded.

## `target.sha256`

One line: the lowercase hex SHA-256 of `target.json`, nothing else.

## `codex-input.md`

Composed by the review runner, never by the implementing agent (§2.2). Must
contain the `target.sha256` value verbatim somewhere in its text — MC-2 check
10. That string is the binding between what was frozen and what the reviewer was
actually shown.

Freezing the target proves the artifact did not change. Only the embedded hash
ties that artifact to the input the reviewer received. This is the control whose
absence made the GSD pilot's criterion 1 unprovable.

## `codex-output-raw.md`

Exactly what Codex returned, captured before any parsing, summarisation or
response. No repair may occur before this file exists.

## Schema-level concretisations

The protocol names logical artifacts; a checker needs to find them on disk.
These are instantiations of the protocol, not changes to it, per Alex Zamurko's
ruling of 8 September on D-3, restated 8 September 2026, 11:01 PM:

    use target.json as the concrete schema/filesystem representation of the
    protocol's logical target. This is an implementation concretisation, not a
    semantic change. The mapping should be documented explicitly so the
    protocol term target remains normative.

So `target` is the normative term and `target.json` is only how this
implementation stores it. Anything reasoning about the protocol says `target`;
only code touching the filesystem says `target.json`. A future implementation
storing it under another name would still conform, and this table is the whole
of what would have to change.

```text
target          → the file target.json
DIFF_HASH       → diff_hash, plus diff_path so check 14 has an artifact to
                  hash. The protocol requires the hash to match the reviewed
                  diff; without a path there is nothing to match against.
TEST_RESULT_HASH→ test_result_hash, plus test_result_path, same reason.
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
                → check 13 compares the target's value against
                  plan-approval/approval.json, which is where Step 7.3 freezes
                  it. Absent that record, the check fails rather than passing
                  vacuously.
```

## What MC-2 does not check

Stated so nobody reads a PASS as more than it is.

- That `codex-output-raw.md` came from the invocation `codex-input.md` describes.
  Nothing in the evidence proves that binding; it rests on the runner behaving,
  and `invocation.json` records how the review was run without claiming more.
- That the reviewer read the whole input.
- That findings in `findings.json` correspond to the raw output. A separate check
  could compare finding IDs against the raw text; it is not among the fifteen.
- Anything about content quality. MC-2 is an evidence-completeness gate.

Checks 11 to 15 do not apply to plan review and are reported `N/A` there, never
`PASS`. A check reporting success on a cycle it never examined would be the
exact defect this gate exists to catch.

Under `CONVENTION_ONLY` the gaps above are procedural, not technical, and the
protocol's language must reflect that.

## Bootstrap exception

Per Alex Zamurko, 8 September. The runner and this checker necessarily precede
the automated protocol they enable, so artifacts produced before both exist and
have passed bootstrap review are:

```text
BOOTSTRAP / DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE — NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE
```

They are not invalid cycles requiring retrospective interpretation. They are not
cycles. No `A1E-001` protocol cycle may be created until the evidence schema is
frozen and the MC-2 checker exists and has passed its own bootstrap review.
```

## `scripts/validate_cycle.py`

`sha256 3d9c570c3a9eb3efcdc2daf1201597af05ad9f20880c74b25f4f607856dcaf60`

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""MC-2 conformance gate.

Checks one review cycle against specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md and MC-2 of the
protocol, which specifies fifteen checks: 1 to 10 for every cycle, and 11 to 15
additionally and unconditionally for implementation review cycles (§10.2).

    python scripts/validate_cycle.py runs/A1E-001/plan-review/cycle-01

Exit 0 = PASS, exit 1 = FAIL, exit 2 = the checker could not run.

A FAIL means REVIEW_CYCLE_STATUS = INVALID: the cycle cannot support a finding
and cannot count toward CONVERGED, STALLED, MAX_4_REACHED, or the four-cycle
budget. It is repaired and rerun, not interpreted.

Checks 11 to 15 apply only to implementation review. On a plan review they are
reported N/A rather than PASS. A check that reports success on a cycle it never
examined is the defect this gate exists to prevent, and it would be perverse to
build one into the gate itself.

Written under the anti-whitelist rule: every check derives its expectation from
the protocol text, and nothing passes because a previous run accepted it.

MC-1 boundary, CONVENTION_ONLY on this environment
--------------------------------------------------
codex-input.md is composed here and never by the implementing agent. That
separation is a convention this script follows. It is not something the script
can enforce: the implementing agent holds write access to these paths. No claim
of technical protection may be made while MC1_ENFORCEMENT is CONVENTION_ONLY.

Write-once evidence
-------------------
target.json, target.sha256, codex-input.md and codex-output-raw.md are never
overwritten. A cycle that went wrong is repaired by opening a new cycle, not by
editing the old one. `freeze` refuses on an existing cycle directory; `record`
refuses when raw output is already present.

What this runner does not establish
-----------------------------------
It does not invoke the reviewer. It cannot show that codex-output-raw.md came
from the invocation codex-input.md describes; that binding rests on the operator
and is recorded, not proven, in invocation.json. This is the same limit stated
in specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md, restated here so it is visible at the point of
use.

"""Finding and state ledger.

Tracks every Codex finding through OPEN / RESOLVED / DISPUTED across the cycles
of one review loop, with a full audit trail and no illegal transitions.

    python scripts/ledger.py raise   --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --class "UNTESTED RULE" --requirement R-B7
    python scripts/ledger.py respond --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --disposition ACCEPT --note "..."
    python scripts/ledger.py resolve --review <dir> --cycle 2 --id C01-F01 \
        --evidence "repaired in 02-PLAN.md §4"
    python scripts/ledger.py show    --review <dir> [--cycle N]

Exit 0 = done, 1 = refused, 2 = could not run.

The three states are the protocol's, §6: OPEN, RESOLVED, DISPUTED. There is no
fourth.

Why ACCEPT does not resolve
---------------------------
§5: on ACCEPT the finding's state becomes RESOLVED "once the repair is
demonstrated in the next review target". So accepting records a disposition and
leaves the state OPEN. Only a later cycle can move it to RESOLVED, and this
ledger refuses to do it in the same cycle as the ACCEPT.

That is not pedantry. If ACCEPT alone resolved a finding, the implementing agent
would close its own findings by asserting it intended to fix them, which is the
authority inversion MC-1 exists to prevent.

Who declares a repair demonstrated
----------------------------------
The protocol does not say mechanically, and this ledger does not invent an
answer. `resolve` requires an explicit evidence string and refuses without a
prior ACCEPT, so the assertion is recorded and attributable rather than implied.
See DECISIONS below.

DISPUTED is terminal here
-------------------------
§5 says a dispute "requires human adjudication" and §7.1 puts that at the human
gate. Nothing in the automated loop may move a finding out of DISPUTED, so this
ledger refuses. Adjudication belongs to the approval record, not here.

"""Loop-state controller.

Computes CONVERGED / HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED / STALLED / MAX_4_REACHED /
CONTINUE for one review loop, per §6 and §13 of the protocol, and shows the
working.

    python scripts/loop_state.py --review runs/A1E-001/plan-review

Exit 0 = a state was determined, 2 = could not run.
The state itself is on stdout as LOOP_STATUS; it is not an exit code, because
CONTINUE is not a failure and STALLED is not an error.

Validity is computed, not trusted
---------------------------------
§2 : "Only cycles that pass the MC-2 conformance gate count toward this maximum."
§3 : an invalid cycle "cannot support an authoritative Codex finding" and
     "cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles".

So this runs scripts/validate_cycle.py on every cycle directory rather than
reading a recorded verdict. A loop controller that accepted an asserted PASS
would let an invalid cycle consume the budget, which is the exact defect the
"MAX 4 counts valid cycles" note exists to prevent.

Two consequences, both deliberate and both worth disagreeing with if you see it
differently:

1. §6's n indexes VALID cycles, not directory numbers. If cycle-02 fails the
   gate, then cycle-03 is n=2. Otherwise |OPEN_n| would be compared against a
   cycle whose evidence is not authoritative.

2. Events recorded in an invalid cycle are ignored entirely, including
   resolutions. A finding accepted in valid cycle 1 and marked demonstrated in
   invalid cycle 2 stays OPEN, because the cycle that would demonstrate it
   cannot support an authoritative anything. This is the conservative reading
   and it can only ever delay an exit, never manufacture one.

What this does not do
---------------------
It does not decide whether a repair was demonstrated; the ledger records that
assertion and this reads it. It does not adjudicate disputes. And CONVERGED
here means the finding sets are empty, not that the plan is good.

"""The one-time bootstrap review, and the gate that makes it mandatory.

    python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py check
    python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py record --decision APPROVE \\
        --decided-by "Alex Zamurko" --note "..."

Exit 0 = a bootstrap review exists, was approved, and still covers the code that
is actually on disk.
Exit 1 = it does not, and no real protocol cycle may run.
Exit 2 = could not run.

Why this exists
---------------
The orchestrator exists to constrain the implementing agent, and the implementing
agent wrote it. The MC-2 checker decides whether a cycle counts, and the same
agent wrote that too. Neither can go through the process it enables, because the
process does not exist until they do.

Alex Zamurko ruled on 8 September 2026:

    Make a one-time BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW mandatory before relying on those
    components for real protocol cycles. Preserve the exact bootstrap input, raw
    Codex output, findings, responses, and human decision.

So this is the one declared exception to the protocol, made explicit and made
enforceable rather than left as a paragraph someone remembers.

The part that is easy to get wrong
----------------------------------
A gate that only asks "did a bootstrap review happen" passes forever. The review
would authorise the code as it stood that day, the code would change the next
morning, and the gate would keep saying yes about a file that no longer exists in
the form anyone reviewed. That is the same defect as a green test pinned to a
superseded protocol, one level up.

So the decision record pins the sha256 of every component it covers, and `check`
re-hashes them. Editing a reviewed component invalidates the review, by design.
Re-reviewing is the cost of changing the thing that everything else trusts.

    Derived by walking references rather than listed by hand, because a

    Deliberately over-inclusive: a scripts/*.py named anywhere in a covered file,

    cost of over-inclusion is that an unrelated edit forces a re-review. The cost
