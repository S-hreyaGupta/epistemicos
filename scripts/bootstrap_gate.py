"""The one-time bootstrap review, and the gate that makes it mandatory.

    python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py check
    python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py record --decision APPROVE \\
        --decided-by "Alex Zamurko" --note "..."

Exit 0 = a bootstrap review exists, was approved, and still covers the code that
is actually on disk.
Exit 1 = it does not, and no real protocol cycle may run.
Exit 2 = could not run.

Why this exists
---------------
The orchestrator exists to constrain the implementing agent, and the implementing
agent wrote it. The MC-2 checker decides whether a cycle counts, and the same
agent wrote that too. Neither can go through the process it enables, because the
process does not exist until they do.

Alex Zamurko ruled on 8 September 2026:

    Make a one-time BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW mandatory before relying on those
    components for real protocol cycles. Preserve the exact bootstrap input, raw
    Codex output, findings, responses, and human decision.

So this is the one declared exception to the protocol, made explicit and made
enforceable rather than left as a paragraph someone remembers.

The part that is easy to get wrong
----------------------------------
A gate that only asks "did a bootstrap review happen" passes forever. The review
would authorise the code as it stood that day, the code would change the next
morning, and the gate would keep saying yes about a file that no longer exists in
the form anyone reviewed. That is the same defect as a green test pinned to a
superseded protocol, one level up.

So the decision record pins the sha256 of every component it covers, and `check`
re-hashes them. Editing a reviewed component invalidates the review, by design.
Re-reviewing is the cost of changing the thing that everything else trusts.

    Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026:

        If validate_cycle.py or run_review.py imports repository-local modules
        whose changes can alter their behaviour, pinning only the two top-level
        files is insufficient. Either include those executable dependencies in
        the bootstrap decision hash set, or establish that the two files are
        behaviorally self-contained.

    They are not self-contained. run_review.py loads bootstrap_gate.py by path
    and invokes validate_cycle.py as a subprocess; loop_state.py invokes
    validate_cycle.py too. Editing a dependency changes a reviewed component's
    behaviour without changing its bytes, so a hash set of top-level files only
    is a hash set with a hole in it.

    Derived by walking references rather than listed by hand, because a
    hand-maintained dependency list is one that is right on the day it is written
    and silently wrong afterwards, which is the failure this whole gate exists to
    prevent one level down.

    Deliberately over-inclusive: a scripts/*.py named anywhere in a covered file,
    including in a usage line in its docstring, is treated as a dependency. The
    cost of over-inclusion is that an unrelated edit forces a re-review. The cost
    of under-inclusion is a component whose behaviour changed while its approval
    still verified. Those are not comparable, so the ambiguity resolves toward
    covering more.
