"""The one parser for reviewer output, and the one Finding ID grammar.

Imported by the runner, which writes findings.json, and by the MC-2 checker,
which verifies it. One module rather than two implementations, because the
failure this closes is components each enforcing their own idea of the format.

Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026:

    Prompt, parser, and ledger must not independently impose different
    grammars. The clean choice is: the review format defines the canonical
    grammar, the runner validates it, and the ledger preserves it unchanged.

That happened. The prompt said `B01-F01`, the ledger demanded `C{cycle}-F{nn}`,
and eighteen findings were renamed between the review and the record. A second
copy of this logic anywhere would be a fourth grammar with the same problem, so
there is exactly one, and the grammar itself is read from the schema rather than
restated here.

    a cycle was parsed with passes it; a caller parsing something new passes
