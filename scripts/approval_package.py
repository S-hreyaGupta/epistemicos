"""Assemble the §7 human review package for a run.

    python scripts/approval_package.py --run BOOTSTRAP-002 --type plan
    python scripts/approval_package.py --run BOOTSTRAP-002 --type plan --out PACKAGE.md

Exit 0 = a package was written, and it states which §7 items it could not fill.
Exit 1 = refused; nothing written.

Why this exists
---------------
§7 requires a human to review the plan after CONVERGED, HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED,
STALLED or MAX_4_REACHED, and lists ten things the package must contain. Nothing
built them. The consequence was not that approval was hard, it was that approval
had no defined subject: a human was being asked to approve a directory.

Every figure here is taken from the tool that owns it, by running that tool and
quoting what it said. None of it is recomputed locally. That is the whole design:
a package that recomputed loop status would be a second controller, and two
implementations of one rule is the defect this layer keeps finding in itself. If
a tool refuses, the refusal is what the package records — not a gap, and not a
guess at what the answer would have been.

What it does not do
-------------------
It does not decide anything, and it writes nothing into any ledger. The decision
is recorded by `bootstrap_gate.py record`, which is a separate act by a separate
person.

It cannot produce the SPEC → CODE → TEST mapping of §7 for a bootstrap run,
because that mapping is the output of a §1 plan audit and a bootstrap run has no
plan. It says so rather than leaving the heading out, because a reviewer who
cannot see what is missing cannot weigh it.
