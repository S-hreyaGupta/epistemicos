# Bootstrap review prompt — BOOTSTRAP-002, cycle 01

First cycle of a second `BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW` of the execution layer. Hand-written,
per Alex Zamurko, 8 September: a hand-written prompt is acceptable for the
bootstrap. This is not one of the five production prompts.

**Findings from this cycle are `C01-Fnn`.** The letter is the run, not the
cycle. `B` belongs to BOOTSTRAP-001 and its identifiers are quoted throughout
this document; raising a `B01-Fnn` here would give one name to two defects in
two ledgers.

---

## Why there is a second run at all

BOOTSTRAP-001 closed on 16 September at `MAX_4_REACHED` with five findings
`OPEN`. All five have since been repaired. None has been seen by a reviewer.

§5 gives `RESOLVED` only once a repair is demonstrated in the **next review
target**, and that loop has no next target. So those five cannot close in their
own ledger however thoroughly they are fixed. Alex Zamurko, 16 September:

> Do not close them by human assertion and do not create cycle 05. Start a
> separate, bounded bootstrap-verification run whose purpose is to independently
> demonstrate those five repairs. Cross-reference the original IDs.

That is this run. It is also why nothing here may write into BOOTSTRAP-001's
ledger: this run has its own, and a demonstration recorded here is descriptive
metadata there, never a §5 transition.

**This is development evidence, not a protocol outcome.** The gate still reports
no bootstrap review on record, so no real protocol cycle can run. `BOOTSTRAP-002`
is marked `NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE` and the controller refuses to state an
authoritative loop result for it.

**Nothing here is technically enforced.** `MC1_ENFORCEMENT` is
`CONVENTION_ONLY`. Every check in this layer is detection that holds while the
checks run faithfully and nobody edits the records they read. The same writable
code performs the checks on itself.

---

## What this cycle is for

**1. Are the five repairs demonstrated?** For each, does the current code fix
what the original finding described, and do its controls establish that it does?

**2. Is anything else wrong?** Every file in the target changed after cycle 04
froze, and a good deal changed again on 17 September. None of it has been
reviewed. New defects are ordinary findings.

### What the first run's record suggests about how to spend the time

Across BOOTSTRAP-001, repair claims were examined and rejected at roughly two in
five, in every cycle including the last: 5 of 13, then 9 of 20, then 5 of 11.
**The rate never fell.** That is offered not as a prediction but because a
reviewer expecting claims to hold reads past the ones that do not.

Cycle 04's closing observation was that all five remaining findings shared one
shape: **the control tested the case its repair was built for and missed the
adjacent one.** The check worked when called and was not called from the second
place. The refusal fired on the tested input and a neighbouring input reached
the same state by another route. Mutation testing did not catch it, because
breaking the fix does make those controls fail; they were not asking a wide
enough question.

Six of the twenty-five findings BOOTSTRAP-001 marked `RESOLVED` were never
re-verified. The honest reading is that the resolved set likely contains defects
of this shape too, and it is in scope here.

## The account below is the implementing agent's own

Everything in the repair sections is Claude's description of Claude's work. No
one else has checked it. It is supplied so the cycle is spent on verification
rather than rediscovery, and it should be treated as a claim, not as evidence.

A finding listed as repaired that is not repaired is a finding about this prompt
as much as about the code. BOOTSTRAP-001's cycle 03 raised exactly that, as
B03-F02, about that run's cycle-02 prompt, and was right to.

---

## What you are reviewing

**Nine artifacts**, hashed and listed in `target.json`. BOOTSTRAP-001's cycles
02 to 04 reviewed ten. The tenth is `specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md`, and it is
absent here deliberately.

`run_pins.py` opens with the rule: *which artifacts govern a run, and which are
under review. Never both.* That is Alex Zamurko's Run-Pin and Review-Target
Separation Specification of 10 September, whose governing invariant is that no
review process may require an artifact to remain byte-invariant for the duration
of a run while simultaneously requiring that same version to change in order to
resolve findings. It was written because BOOTSTRAP-001 required exactly that of
the schema.

This run pins the schema as its governing spec, so this cycle cannot review it.
**Cycle 02 will, under a pin amendment that moves it between roles**, which is
what `pin-amendments.json` and `pins_for_cycle` exist for.

Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering. The gate's covered set
is ten, so no approval resting on this run alone can claim the schema was
reviewed — that needs cycle 02. And the schema's current bytes have been
reviewed by nobody: BOOTSTRAP-001 pinned `98a5920d…` and this run pins
`4203ba64…`, so it was amended after the first run froze and no cycle has seen
the version in the tree today.

```text
scripts/validate_cycle.py       the MC-2 conformance gate, fifteen checks
scripts/run_review.py           the review runner
scripts/ledger.py               the finding and state ledger
scripts/loop_state.py           the loop-state controller
scripts/bootstrap_gate.py       the gate enforcing this review
scripts/findings_format.py      the single parser: raw reviewer output to
                                structured findings
scripts/cycle_projection.py     what counts as a cycle, for both the ledger and
                                the controller

                                under review
```

The gate's covered set is read from `bootstrap_gate.covered()` rather than
asserted from memory. It is ten, and all ten are named in this document. Nine of
them are in this cycle's target; the tenth is the governing spec, as above.

### The control suites are auxiliary evidence, not members of the target

`target_drift` refuses extra target artifacts, and widening the gate's covered
set is a change Alex Zamurko has not made. The five suites are hashed into a
manifest recorded beside the target at freeze; `target.json` records the manifest
digest and `target.sha256` covers that. Their exact versions are identifiable
from this cycle's evidence, but the target hash does not bind their contents
directly.

```text
scripts/test_validate_cycle.py   33 controls
scripts/test_run_review.py       127 controls
scripts/test_ledger.py           87 controls, covering the ledger and controller
scripts/test_bootstrap_gate.py   43 controls
scripts/test_interfaces.py       29 controls, across eleven component seams
```

Those counts total 319, produced by `scripts/refresh_counts.py` and checked by
`scripts/test_prompts.py` against the suites themselves.

**`refresh_counts.py` is not in the covered set and not in this target.** You are
being given a number by a tool you cannot inspect, and the tool has been wrong
three times. It once recorded 29 controls where there were 95, because a suite
crashed part-way and emitted no failure. On 15 September it was found rewriting
the prompts of already-frozen cycles, so one prompt asserted 298 controls for a
review conducted against 263 — and the check that should have caught it compared
the rewritten document against the same suites just written into it. On 17
September it was found resolving a prompt's frozen input by globbing every run,
so a prompt for this run's first cycle would have been declared frozen by
BOOTSTRAP-001's first cycle and never updated.

A count cannot show that the intended refusal is what made a test pass. If a
count supplied from outside the target is not evidence you can use, say so as a
finding.

---

## The five repairs, to verify

Each names its BOOTSTRAP-001 identifier. Those findings remain `OPEN` in that
run's ledger and will stay `OPEN` permanently; what this cycle can establish is
whether the repair holds.

**B01-F02 · the budget could still be extended.** `MAX_4_REACHED` was made
unclearable, and that was not enough: §6 evaluates `STALLED` before the budget,
so a fourth boundary that genuinely stalls never met the unclearable list, and
clearing it returned `CONTINUE` with the ceiling never consulted. The controller
told the operator to open cycle five while the runner refused it. *Repair: the
ceiling is checked on the way out rather than trusting the shape of whichever
exit was cleared.* Commit `76e102b`.

**B01-F07 · the gate checked that fields agreed, not that they were true.** A
target was built whose governing pin named a file that does not exist, with
`"not-a-hash"` as its digest, consistent across both fields. Check 9 passed and
MC-2 returned PASS. *Repair: check 9 replays the run's own pin history for the
cycle and requires the recorded governing set to be the one that history
produced; which pin counts as the protocol comes from what the run declares
rather than from whichever entry matched the field under test.* Commit
`c584e66`. The control that matters is the one where the governing set is well
formed, names the real protocol with its real digest, and is internally
consistent throughout — its only defect is a spec the run never pinned, which
nothing but the run's history can see.

**B01-F11 · a backdated acceptance revived a reopened finding.** Accept at cycle
1, demonstrate at 2, reopen at 3, then append an acceptance dated cycle 2 and
demonstrate at 4. The ledger stored `RESOLVED`. No acceptance ever belonged to
the reopening cycle or later. *Repair: two guards, because refusing to write one
is not refusing to use one. The ledger will not record a disposition dated
before the reopening it answers, and replay will not honour one already in the
history.* Commit `4b36083`.

**B01-F14 · deleting the whole file bypassed the check for the missing field.**
Removing `mc1_enforcement` from `run.json` was refused, exit 2. Removing
`run.json` entirely exited 0 with an unqualified `CONVERGED`, because
classification returned UNKNOWN before the shared metadata check ran. *Repair:
authoritative calculation is refused when run metadata cannot be established at
all, with no labelled fallback, since calling an unreadable run "development
evidence" would be a claim about it.* Commit `c617333`.

**B02-F04 · the atomic commit point was preceded by a destructive write.**
Publication turned on one atomic rename, but recording wrote `capture-log.json`
non-atomically twice during preparation. Truncating it there left the previous
generation on disk with nothing able to say which attempt it was. *Repair: every
write to that file is atomic.* Commit `5201396`.

**The control for B02-F04 is weaker than the others and is marked so.** It reads
the source and requires every write to that file to use the atomic path, rather
than injecting a crash, which a suite driving the runner as a subprocess cannot
do. Alex Zamurko accepted it on 16 September as *structural evidence, not
behavioural fault-injection evidence*, conditional on the atomic primitive
itself having behavioural tests. It had none. Three were added on 17 September,
and within the hour they found that a failed write left its staging file behind.
That is fixed, and the sequence is worth knowing: the structural control said
every write goes through the primitive, which was true and said nothing about
what the primitive does on the way down.

---

## What changed on 16 and 17 September, none of it reviewed

**`SOURCE` on every finding.** Closing B02-F11, open since 10 September: does a
defect the implementing agent finds in its own work enter the ledger? Ruled yes,
with provenance — `CODEX_REVIEW`, `IMPLEMENTER_SELF_FOUND`, `HUMAN_REVIEW` —
persistent identifiers and ordinary lifecycle state, distinguished from reviewer
findings and requiring independent verification before closure like any other.
Required with no default: a default of `CODEX_REVIEW` would mean a defect
recorded without the flag silently claims reviewer provenance. The thirty
BOOTSTRAP-001 findings predate the field and report as `UNRECORDED` rather than
being backfilled.

**`REPAIR_STATUS` beside the state.** `OPEN` currently means two things in
BOOTSTRAP-001's ledger — not repaired, and repaired but undemonstrable there.
This records the difference without touching the three-state vocabulary. Alex
Zamurko's constraint, 17 September: *external demonstration may update
descriptive repair/closure metadata, but must never masquerade as a §5
`RESOLVED` transition in the original ledger*, and neither field may affect
`OPEN_n`, convergence, stall, or cycle counting.

That constraint is under a control which captures the controller's output and
the per-cycle snapshot, writes every non-authoritative field onto the findings,
recomputes both, and fails if either moved by a byte. Another tries
`--status RESOLVED` and requires a refusal. **Whether those two are sufficient
is a fair question for this cycle.**

**The fixture-validity audit**, Alex Zamurko's item C of 16 September: each
negative control should first establish that its fixture satisfies all
prerequisites except the single condition it intends to violate. Two suites had
real gaps.

In the ledger suite, scenarios built fixtures by calling the ledger and ignoring
the result, so a fixture that failed to build was asserted over rather than
reported. All four scenario helpers now require every setup call to succeed.
`scenario_absent` needed it most: it asserts an absence, and an empty fixture
satisfies an absence perfectly, so it was a check that could not come back
false.

In the cycle-validation suite, `expect_fail` asserted the intended check went red
and never asked what else did. It now requires that check to be the only failure
unless the cascade is declared.

**The audit was not exhaustive and this prompt does not claim it was.** The
runner suite is 127 controls and was sampled, not audited. The gate and interface
suites were found already conformant. If the sampling is not good enough to rest
an approval on, that is a finding.

### One pattern found three times in a day, and probably not three times in total

Creating a second run broke three rules that had been correct for as long as
there was exactly one. None of them errored; each quietly answered a different
question from the one it appeared to answer.

```text
refresh_counts.frozen_input   resolved a prompt's frozen input by globbing every
                              run, so a prompt for this cycle would have been
                              declared frozen by BOOTSTRAP-001's cycle 01 and
                              never given today's counts

test_prompts, finding-ID      hardcoded the prefix letter as B, so a prompt using
                              the letter its own run raises under would have
                              failed a check meant to confirm it used the right
                              one

test_prompts, covered set     took "current prompt" to be the highest cycle
                              number, so this prompt was written, the check ran
                              green, and what it had graded was a prompt frozen
                              the day before
```

The third was found by reading the output of a green run rather than by any
control failing, which is the only reason it is in this list instead of still
being true.

These are all in tooling outside the target, so they are not findings against the
reviewed set. They are offered because the same substitution — one run, one
cycle numbering, one ledger — is made in places that *are* in the target, and
three for three is a poor rate to stop looking at.

---

## What you are reviewing them against

The protocol and the evidence schema named in `run.json`, and nothing else. Both
are pinned at freeze and their digests are in `target.json`.

The six finding classes of §4 are closed. `OUT OF VOCABULARY` remains available
as a human-visible diagnostic: no Finding ID, never written to `findings.json`,
never in a lifecycle state, no effect on loop state. The ledger refuses it by
name.

---

## Reporting

One block per finding, in the §4 format, with `Finding ID: C01-F01` and upward.

Where a finding concerns one of the five repairs above, name the BOOTSTRAP-001
identifier in the evidence so the two records can be joined. A repair you cannot
verify should be reported as unverified rather than given the benefit of the
doubt.

State plainly at the end whether this review converged, and if it makes no such
claim, say that instead. Every cycle of BOOTSTRAP-001 ended by saying it made no
claim of convergence, and each time that was the accurate thing to say.

---

# The governing protocol

`specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.1.md`, sha256 `296594a3c06cd2f9c66976c369b15804f39bbb2be37b5e62234d37fafd28d483`.

This is the document the artifacts below are reviewed against. Where
it and the review prompt disagree, this governs.

```
Claude–Codex Minimal Implementation and Review Workflow
0. Protocol governance and baseline
0.1 Governing protocol
This workflow is a version-controlled governing specification.
Before any implementation run begins, the authoritative protocol must itself be committed to git.
Recommended location:
specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.1.md

Record:
PROTOCOL_PATH
PROTOCOL_VERSION
PROTOCOL_COMMIT
PROTOCOL_HASH

The authoritative protocol is the git-controlled artifact.
Slack, chat history, .docx drafts, or other transient communication channels are not authoritative copies.
Every implementation run must reference the exact protocol version, commit, and hash used.
No implementation run may begin until these fields are populated.

0.2 Freeze the specification and baseline
Record:
SPEC_PATH
SPEC_VERSION
SPEC_HASH

BASELINE_COMMIT
BASELINE_TEST_RESULT
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT
GOLD_SET_VERSION
GOLD_SET_HASH

If no executable implementation exists yet:
BASELINE_COMMIT: NONE
BASELINE_TEST_RESULT: NOT_APPLICABLE
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT: NOT_APPLICABLE
REASON: no executable baseline implementation

A baseline result must never be manufactured retrospectively.
Where an executable baseline exists, the frozen Gold Set must be run before implementation.

1. Claude audits frozen spec → current code
Claude audits every implementable requirement in the frozen specification against the current implementation.
Each requirement receives exactly one disposition:
DONE
PARTIAL
MISSING
CONFLICT

Claude produces:
SPEC → CODE → TEST mapping

For each requirement:
Requirement ID:
Spec location:
Normative requirement:

Disposition:
DONE | PARTIAL | MISSING | CONFLICT

Current code:
Current tests:

Required implementation delta:
Required deterministic/conformance test:
Dependencies/blockers:

Claude then produces a bounded implementation plan containing only changes justified by the audit.
No implementation occurs at this stage.

2. Plan review loop — Claude ↔ Codex
Maximum:
4 VALID CODEX REVIEW CYCLES

Only cycles that pass the MC-2 conformance gate count toward this maximum.

2.1 Freeze the review target for every cycle
Every cycle receives its own directory.
Example:
plan-review/
cycle-01/
cycle-02/
cycle-03/
cycle-04/

Before Codex review:
target
target.sha256

must be created.
target identifies or contains the exact plan artifact to be reviewed in that cycle.
A repaired plan creates a new target and therefore a new review cycle.

2.2 Review runner composes the Codex input
The implementing agent does not construct or supply the authoritative Codex review input.
The review runner:
reads the frozen target;
calculates/verifies target.sha256;
composes codex-input.md;
includes the exact target SHA-256 verbatim in codex-input.md;
supplies the frozen target or its exact referenced content to Codex;
writes the resulting Codex output to the review evidence directory.
Required relationship:
target
↓
review runner
↓
codex-input.md
↓
Codex
↓
codex-output-raw.md

The implementing agent may trigger the review process but may not alter the authoritative codex-input.md after composition.

3. Mandatory controls for every Codex review cycle
MC-1 — Reviewer input/output boundary
Codex review evidence must be technically separated from the implementing agent where infrastructure permits.
The review runner owns creation of:
target.sha256
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md
findings.json

After capture:
Claude / implementing agent:

READ:
permitted where required

WRITE:
denied

DELETE:
denied

for authoritative review evidence.
Claude may write separately:
claude-response.md
repaired-target

Claude may not overwrite:
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md
findings.json

Input-side control
The review runner, not Claude, composes codex-input.md from the frozen target.
Therefore the implementing agent does not control either:
what authoritative artifact Codex is shown
or
what authoritative Codex response is retained

Enforcement status
Each run records:
MC1_ENFORCEMENT:
TECHNICALLY_ENFORCED
or
CONVENTION_ONLY

If infrastructure cannot enforce write/delete restrictions:
MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY

must be recorded.
In that case, claims such as:
Codex findings are immutable
review input is technically protected

must not be made.
The protocol then provides procedural discipline, not a technical guarantee.

MC-2 — Per-cycle evidence completeness and target-binding gate
Every completed review cycle must contain:
target
target.sha256
codex-input.md
codex-output-raw.md

A deterministic conformance check must verify:
1. target exists

2. target.sha256 exists

3. codex-input.md exists

4. codex-output-raw.md exists

5. all required files are non-empty

6. SHA256(target)
==
value recorded in target.sha256

7. cycle identifier is unique

8. where target references a git commit:
referenced commit exists

9. all mandatory hashed artifacts for that review type
are present and their recorded hashes match the referenced artifacts

10. codex-input.md contains the exact target SHA-256 verbatim

Check 10 creates the required binding:
frozen target
↕
target SHA-256
↕
actual Codex input

A review is therefore not valid merely because a frozen artifact and a Codex response both exist. The recorded input must demonstrably reference the exact frozen target.
Result:
MC2_CONFORMANCE:
PASS | FAIL

If:
MC2_CONFORMANCE = FAIL

then:
REVIEW_CYCLE_STATUS = INVALID

An invalid cycle:
cannot support an authoritative Codex finding;
cannot count toward CONVERGED;
cannot count toward HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED;
cannot count toward STALLED;
cannot count toward MAX_4_REACHED;
cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles.
The evidence failure must be corrected and the review rerun.

MC-3 — Gold Set performance is comparative where a baseline exists
Where executable baseline code exists, preserve Gold Set results:
BEFORE implementation
AND
AFTER final implementation

using the same frozen Gold Set version/hash.
Where no executable baseline exists:
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT = NOT_APPLICABLE

and the candidate is evaluated against predefined Gold acceptance criteria.

4. Codex reviews the implementation plan
Codex reviews the exact frozen plan against the frozen specification.
Codex uses the following closed finding vocabulary:
MISSING REQUIREMENT

WRONG OWNERSHIP

NONDETERMINISTIC WHERE D POSSIBLE

SEMANTIC STEP TOO BROAD

UNTESTED RULE

CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

Every finding receives a persistent identifier.
Example:
Finding ID: C02-F03
Class: UNTESTED RULE
Requirement ID: R-B7
Evidence:
Finding:
Required correction:

The vocabulary remains unchanged across cycles so that finding sets remain comparable.
The raw Codex response is captured before summarisation, interpretation, or Claude response.

5. Claude responds to Codex findings
Claude must respond to every finding with exactly one disposition:
ACCEPT

or:
REJECT_WITH_REASON

ACCEPT
Claude accepts the finding and repairs the plan.
The original Codex finding remains unchanged in the authoritative review record.
Its state becomes:
RESOLVED

once the repair is demonstrated in the next review target.

REJECT_WITH_REASON
Claude records:
Finding ID:
Disposition: REJECT_WITH_REASON
Reason:
Spec evidence:

Claude does not erase, rewrite, or close the Codex finding.
Its state becomes:
DISPUTED

and requires human adjudication.

6. Mechanically determine the plan-loop state
For each valid cycle, every Codex finding has one current state:
OPEN
RESOLVED
DISPUTED

Define:
OPEN_n
= set of actionable OPEN finding IDs after cycle n

RESOLVED_NEW_n
= findings that were OPEN after cycle n-1
and became RESOLVED during cycle n

DISPUTED_NEW_n
= findings that were OPEN after cycle n-1
and became DISPUTED during cycle n

For cycle n > 1, progress exists iff:
|OPEN_n| < |OPEN_n-1|

OR

RESOLVED_NEW_n is non-empty

OR

DISPUTED_NEW_n is non-empty

A newly recorded dispute counts as progress because an unresolved finding has been converted into an explicit human-adjudication issue.
Merely re-raising an already existing dispute does not count as progress.

Exit A — CONVERGED
OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n = ∅

Stop the automated plan loop.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = CONVERGED

Exit B — HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n ≠ ∅

All actionable findings have been resolved or converted into disputes, and no further automated repair is available.
Stop the automated plan loop immediately.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED

Exit C — STALLED
For any valid cycle n > 1:
STALLED
IFF

|OPEN_n| >= |OPEN_n-1|

AND

RESOLVED_NEW_n = ∅

AND

DISPUTED_NEW_n = ∅

The immediately preceding valid cycle therefore produced:
no reduction in open actionable findings;
no newly resolved finding;
no newly disputed finding.
Stop the automated loop immediately.
Proceed to human plan review with:
LOOP_STATUS = STALLED

Exit D — MAX_4_REACHED
If:
VALID_CYCLE_COUNT = 4

and none of CONVERGED, HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED, or an earlier STALLED exit occurred:
LOOP_STATUS = MAX_4_REACHED

Stop automated review.

Otherwise — CONTINUE
If:
not CONVERGED
not HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
not STALLED
VALID_CYCLE_COUNT < 4

Claude repairs the plan.
A new plan version is produced.
Return to Step 2 and create a new per-cycle review target.

7. Human review of the implementation plan
Human review occurs after:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
or
MAX_4_REACHED

These states are not equivalent.
The review package must contain:
final plan
final plan hash

loop status
valid iteration count

SPEC → CODE → TEST mapping

resolved findings
disputes
unresolved findings

MC-1 enforcement status
MC-2 conformance results for every valid cycle

7.1 Disputes
A dispute is:
Codex finding
+
Claude REJECT_WITH_REASON

The human adjudicates the dispute.

7.2 Unresolved findings
An unresolved finding remains:
OPEN

The human determines whether it:
requires correction
is explicitly waived/accepted
or
causes rejection of the plan

Disputes and unresolved findings must be presented separately.

7.3 Human decision
Permitted outcomes:
APPROVE
RETURN_FOR_REWORK
REJECT

If approved:
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
APPROVAL_RECORD

are frozen.

8. Claude implements the approved plan
Claude implements only the exact approved plan.
Before Codex implementation review, run:
build/check
deterministic tests
conformance tests
regression tests

Mechanical or deterministic failures return directly to Claude for repair.

9. PLAN_DEVIATION control
A material change outside the approved plan may not be introduced silently.
If implementation requires such a change:
1. STOP implementation.

2. Record:
PLAN_DEVIATION_ID
reason
affected requirement
proposed plan change
affected code/tests

3. Do not implement the deviation.

4. Return to Step 7:
HUMAN REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

5. Human reviews the revised plan.

6. If approved:
freeze new APPROVED_PLAN_HASH.

7. Resume implementation only against the newly approved plan.

Therefore:
MATERIAL PLAN DEVIATION
→ MANDATORY RETURN TO HUMAN PLAN APPROVAL

A deviation cannot be legitimised retrospectively during code review.

10. Implementation review loop — Claude ↔ Codex
Maximum:
4 VALID CODEX REVIEW CYCLES

The same MC-1, MC-2 and loop-state rules apply.
Every cycle receives its own directory:
implementation-review/
cycle-01/
cycle-02/
cycle-03/
cycle-04/

10.1 Freeze the exact implementation target per cycle
For implementation review, the target must identify all of the following:
CANDIDATE_COMMIT
CANDIDATE_TREE_HASH
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
DIFF_HASH
TEST_RESULT_HASH

These fields are mandatory, not conditional.
The target must bind the review to:
exact candidate code
exact approved plan
exact implementation diff
exact deterministic/conformance/regression results

Before Codex review:
target
target.sha256

are frozen.
The review runner then composes:
codex-input.md

from that frozen target and includes target.sha256 verbatim.
After Codex returns:
codex-output-raw.md

is captured before any implementation repair.

10.2 Implementation-specific MC-2 checks
For every implementation review cycle, the conformance gate must additionally and unconditionally verify:
11. candidate commit is present and exists

12. candidate tree hash is present
and matches the candidate tree

13. approved-plan hash is present
and matches the frozen approved plan

14. diff hash is present
and matches the exact reviewed diff

15. test-result hash is present
and matches the exact supplied test results

Failure of any check makes the cycle:
INVALID

and it does not consume the four-cycle budget.

11. Codex reviews the exact implementation
Codex receives:
frozen specification
approved plan
exact candidate commit/hash
exact implementation diff
relevant tests
deterministic/conformance/regression results

The authoritative codex-input.md is composed by the review runner, not by Claude.
Codex uses the same closed finding vocabulary:
MISSING REQUIREMENT
WRONG OWNERSHIP
NONDETERMINISTIC WHERE D POSSIBLE
SEMANTIC STEP TOO BROAD
UNTESTED RULE
CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

The raw review is preserved through MC-1 and MC-2.

12. Claude responds and repairs
For every finding:
ACCEPT
→ repair implementation

or:
REJECT_WITH_REASON
→ preserve as DISPUTED

Claude cannot modify the authoritative Codex evidence where MC-1 is technically enforced.
A repair creates a new candidate and therefore a new review cycle.

13. Determine implementation-loop exit
Use exactly the same mechanically defined states and exit order as the plan loop:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
MAX_4_REACHED
CONTINUE

HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
IFF

OPEN_n = ∅
AND
DISPUTED_n ≠ ∅

When this state is reached, stop the automated implementation-review loop immediately and proceed to Step 14 for human adjudication.
No separate or subjective implementation-loop definition is permitted.

14. Human review of final code
Human review occurs after:
CONVERGED
HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED
STALLED
or
MAX_4_REACHED

The review package contains:
frozen specification
approved plan
candidate commit/hash

exact implementation diff
deterministic test results
conformance test results
regression test results

resolved findings
disputes
unresolved findings

loop status
valid iteration count

MC-1 enforcement status
MC-2 result for every valid cycle

any approved plan deviations

Human decision:
APPROVE
RETURN_FOR_REWORK
REJECT

If approved, freeze the exact candidate commit/hash.

15. Gold Set validation
15.1 Existing executable baseline
Run the same frozen Gold Set against:
BASELINE
vs
FINAL CANDIDATE

Compare at minimum:
targeted improvements
previously correct cases retained
new false positives
new false negatives
regressions
aggregate performance

Aggregate improvement does not override an unacceptable regression.

15.2 No executable baseline
Record:
BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT = NOT_APPLICABLE

Run the frozen Gold Set against the candidate and evaluate against predefined acceptance criteria.

16. Final freeze / release decision
The release evidence contains:
PROTOCOL_PATH
PROTOCOL_VERSION
PROTOCOL_COMMIT
PROTOCOL_HASH

SPEC_VERSION
SPEC_HASH

APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
FINAL_CANDIDATE_COMMIT
FINAL_CANDIDATE_HASH

PLAN_LOOP_STATUS
IMPLEMENTATION_LOOP_STATUS

MC1_ENFORCEMENT
MC2_CONFORMANCE_RESULTS

DISPUTE DISPOSITIONS
UNRESOLVED-FINDING DISPOSITIONS

BASELINE_GOLD_RESULT
FINAL_GOLD_RESULT
GOLD_COMPARISON

FINAL HUMAN DECISION

Only then is the capability frozen/released.

Minimal execution view
0. PROTOCOL + BASELINE
Commit/version protocol in git.
Record protocol path/version/commit/hash.

Freeze existing baseline tests + Gold.
If no executable baseline → mark N/A.

# The pinned specification

`specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md`, sha256 `4203ba64bd5ba1db9cd56357c8bf9dd8e6efb419fab7f7635a415c272d3a739c`.

Pinned by this run. The artifacts below are judged against it as well as against
the protocol.

```
# Review evidence schema v1.0

Frozen structure for review-cycle evidence under the implementation and review
protocol. MC-2 checks evidence against this schema, so the schema must be frozen
before any cycle is written: a checker cannot validate a structure that is still
moving.

Derived against the protocol source containing §2.2 and §10.2, which specifies
**fifteen** MC-2 checks — 1 to 10 for every cycle, 11 to 15 additionally and
unconditionally for implementation review.

## Status of this document

```text
MC1_ENFORCEMENT   CONVENTION_ONLY
```

Decided before Run 1 rather than discovered during it. The implementing agent
and the review evidence share one effective write authority on the current
single-user Windows environment, so a technical immutability claim is not
supportable. Per MC-1, claims that Codex findings are immutable or that review
input is technically protected **must not be made** while this holds.

Upgrade to `TECHNICALLY_ENFORCED` only when authoritative review evidence sits
behind a write boundary the implementing agent does not have.

## Directory layout

        ...
    code-approval/
    gold/
```

Cycle directories are `cycle-NN`, zero-padded, starting at `01`. The number is
the cycle identifier and must be unique within its review directory.

## `target.json`

The frozen artifact identity for one cycle. Hashed as a file; that hash is what
binds the cycle together.

Common fields, both review types:

```json
{
  "review_type": "plan" | "implementation",
  "run_id": "A1E-001",
  "cycle": 1,
  "protocol_commit": "…",
  "protocol_sha256": "…",
  "spec_sha256": "…",
  "frozen_at": "2026-09-08T13:40:00Z"
}
```

Plan review adds:

```json
{
  "plan_files": [
    { "path": "runs/A1E-001/plan/01-PLAN.md", "sha256": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Implementation review adds the §10.1 fields. All five are mandatory, not
conditional:

```json
{
  "candidate_commit":    "…",
  "candidate_tree_hash": "…",
  "approved_plan_hash":  "…",
  "diff_path":           "…",
  "diff_hash":           "…",
  "test_result_path":    "…",
  "test_result_hash":    "…"
}
```

`candidate_tree_hash` is derived by the runner from `candidate_commit`, never
supplied by hand. A tree hash typed in by an operator is a tree hash that can be
typed to match whatever was recorded.

## `target.sha256`

One line: the lowercase hex SHA-256 of `target.json`, nothing else.

## `codex-input.md`

Composed by the review runner, never by the implementing agent (§2.2). Must
contain the `target.sha256` value verbatim somewhere in its text — MC-2 check
10. That string is the binding between what was frozen and what the reviewer was
actually shown.

Recording the target's hash detects a later change to the artifact, provided the
check is run and the checking code is faithful. It does not prevent one, and
under `CONVENTION_ONLY` nothing here does. The embedded hash is what ties that
artifact to the input the reviewer received, and its absence is what made the
GSD pilot's criterion 1 unprovable.

An earlier version of this paragraph said freezing "proves the artifact did not
change". Codex raised that as B01-F15 and was right: a hash recorded by the same
authority that can rewrite the artifact establishes drift detection, not
immutability. The distinction is the whole content of MC-1's enforcement-status
field, so the schema should not blur it.

## Canonical Finding ID grammar

One grammar, declared here, validated by the runner, preserved unchanged by the
ledger. Per Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026:

    Prompt, parser, and ledger must not independently impose different
    grammars. The clean choice is: the review format defines the canonical
    grammar, the runner validates it, and the ledger preserves it unchanged.

```text
FINDING_ID_GRAMMAR = ^[A-Z]{0,2}\d{2}-F\d{2,3}$
```

An optional prefix of up to two capitals, the cycle as two digits, `-F`, and the
finding number. `C02-F03` from §4 and `B01-F01` from the bootstrap review both
satisfy it.

This exists because they did diverge. The prompt told the reviewer to use
`B01-F01`; the ledger enforced `C{cycle}-F{nn}`; so eighteen findings were
renamed during transcription and the authoritative record disagreed with the
ledger about what every one of them was called. Renaming a reviewer's identifier
is B01-F13.

An identifier that does not match makes the review result invalid. It is never
silently corrected, because a corrected identifier is a different finding
wearing the right name.

## `codex-output-raw.md`

Exactly what Codex returned, captured before any parsing, summarisation or
response. No repair may occur before this file exists.

## Schema-level concretisations

The protocol names logical artifacts; a checker needs to find them on disk.
These are instantiations of the protocol, not changes to it, per Alex Zamurko's
ruling of 8 September on D-3, restated 8 September 2026, 11:01 PM:

    use target.json as the concrete schema/filesystem representation of the
    protocol's logical target. This is an implementation concretisation, not a
    semantic change. The mapping should be documented explicitly so the
    protocol term target remains normative.

So `target` is the normative term and `target.json` is only how this
implementation stores it. Anything reasoning about the protocol says `target`;
only code touching the filesystem says `target.json`. A future implementation
storing it under another name would still conform, and this table is the whole
of what would have to change.

```text
target          → the file target.json
DIFF_HASH       → diff_hash, plus diff_path so check 14 has an artifact to
                  hash. The protocol requires the hash to match the reviewed
                  diff; without a path there is nothing to match against.
TEST_RESULT_HASH→ test_result_hash, plus test_result_path, same reason.
APPROVED_PLAN_HASH
                → check 13 compares the target's value against
                  plan-approval/approval.json, which is where Step 7.3 freezes
                  it. Absent that record, the check fails rather than passing
                  vacuously.
```

## What MC-2 does not check

Stated so nobody reads a PASS as more than it is.

- That `codex-output-raw.md` came from the invocation `codex-input.md` describes.
  Nothing in the evidence proves that binding; it rests on the runner behaving,
  and `invocation.json` records how the review was run without claiming more.
- That the reviewer read the whole input.
- That findings in `findings.json` correspond to the raw output. A separate check
  could compare finding IDs against the raw text; it is not among the fifteen.
- Anything about content quality. MC-2 is an evidence-completeness gate.

Checks 11 to 15 do not apply to plan review and are reported `N/A` there, never
`PASS`. A check reporting success on a cycle it never examined would be the
exact defect this gate exists to catch.

Under `CONVENTION_ONLY` the gaps above are procedural, not technical, and the
protocol's language must reflect that.

## Bootstrap exception

Per Alex Zamurko, 8 September. The runner and this checker necessarily precede
the automated protocol they enable, so artifacts produced before both exist and
have passed bootstrap review are:

```text
BOOTSTRAP / DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE — NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE
```

They are not invalid cycles requiring retrospective interpretation. They are not
cycles. No `A1E-001` protocol cycle may be created until the evidence schema is
frozen and the MC-2 checker exists and has passed its own bootstrap review.
```

# Artifacts under review

## `scripts/validate_cycle.py`

`sha256 d7183baf425cd3fcd204f85c9301569b6e8c587b33cdb259c1af2c13d013b611`

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""MC-2 conformance gate.

Checks one review cycle against specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md and MC-2 of the
protocol, which specifies fifteen checks: 1 to 10 for every cycle, and 11 to 15
additionally and unconditionally for implementation review cycles (§10.2).

    python scripts/validate_cycle.py runs/A1E-001/plan-review/cycle-01

Exit 0 = PASS, exit 1 = FAIL, exit 2 = the checker could not run.

A FAIL means REVIEW_CYCLE_STATUS = INVALID: the cycle cannot support a finding
and cannot count toward CONVERGED, STALLED, MAX_4_REACHED, or the four-cycle
budget. It is repaired and rerun, not interpreted.

Checks 11 to 15 apply only to implementation review. On a plan review they are
reported N/A rather than PASS. A check that reports success on a cycle it never
examined is the defect this gate exists to prevent, and it would be perverse to
build one into the gate itself.

Written under the anti-whitelist rule: every check derives its expectation from
the protocol text, and nothing passes because a previous run accepted it.

    """Check 9's governing digests, against the run rather than themselves.

    B01-F07, the half cycle 04 found still open. The previous version compared
    the target's assertions with each other: protocol_sha256 had to equal the
    recorded hash of SOME governing pin, and spec_sha256 had to be the digest
    over the rest. Codex wrote a target whose governing set was one file,
    `missing-protocol.md`, which does not exist, carrying the literal
    "not-a-hash", with protocol_sha256 set to the same string and spec_sha256
    set to the digest over the resulting empty remainder. Every comparison
    agreed. Check 9 passed and MC-2 returned PASS.

    Two separate things were wrong.

    Nothing validated the syntax, so a value that is not a digest at all was a
    usable digest. And which pin counted as the protocol was INFERRED from the
    field under test: the old `_owner` picked whichever entry's hash equalled
    protocol_sha256, so the check asked its answer to identify itself. An
    invented set satisfies both conditions as easily as a real one, which is
    why the existing controls stayed green — each changed one assertion and
    kept the other, and none made the whole set false together.

    The comment this replaces said that verifying against run.json and the
    amendment history "would make MC-2 depend on run-level state it does not
    currently read. That is a larger change than this finding, and it is not
    claimed here." Cycle 04 is the finding that says do it. The gate now reads
    the run's own record, replays the pin history for this cycle, and requires
    the recorded set to be the one the run actually produced. The protocol is
    the path the RUN declares, not the entry that happens to match.

    The syntax check below is not load-bearing and is not claimed to be. Any
    value that is not a digest also fails the identity or history comparison,
    because it cannot equal a real hash. It earns its place by failing early
    with a message that names the problem, rather than reporting a mismatch and
    leaving the reader to notice that one side was never a digest at all.

    Still not established, said plainly: this checks the digests against the
    run's history, not the bytes on disk against the digests. An artifact could
    be edited after freeze and both records would still agree. Under
    MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY that remains detection of record drift and
    is not a statement about the files.

MC-1 boundary, CONVENTION_ONLY on this environment
--------------------------------------------------
codex-input.md is composed here and never by the implementing agent. That
separation is a convention this script follows. It is not something the script
can enforce: the implementing agent holds write access to these paths. No claim
of technical protection may be made while MC1_ENFORCEMENT is CONVENTION_ONLY.

Write-once, except where supersession is recorded
-------------------------------------------------
target.json, target.sha256 and codex-input.md are never overwritten. A cycle that
went wrong there is repaired by opening a new cycle, not by editing the old one,
and `freeze` refuses on an existing cycle directory.

codex-output-raw.md is not in that list, and this section used to say it was.
Codex, cycle 03: the old wording "does not describe the current capture-log-based
replacement behavior". A capture can be superseded through the capture log, and
the cycle's working copies are then republished from whichever attempt the log
designates. What is write-once is the attempt directory. Every attempt is kept,
with its own bytes and its own findings, and none is edited after it is written;
the file a consumer reads is a published copy of one of them.

Neither half is technical immutability. Under MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY
the same writable code performs the check.

What this runner does not establish
-----------------------------------
It does not invoke the reviewer. It cannot show that codex-output-raw.md came
from the invocation codex-input.md describes; that binding rests on the operator
and is recorded, not proven, in invocation.json. This is the same limit stated
in specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md, restated here so it is visible at the point of
use.

    have been asked to judge conformance to a document it had never seen and
    would have answered from memory or invention.

    That is the pilot's failure restated: recording an artifact's hash detects a

    ------------------------------------------------
    That argument was made for the protocol and then not carried through.

    Codex: "compose_input carries the protocol but not the pinned spec, and for
    implementation review omits the target identifiers entirely."

    The spec was named by SPEC_SHA256 in the header and never included, so a
    reviewer asked whether a plan satisfies the specification had the hash of a
    document it could not read. And an implementation review was handed the
    artifacts with no candidate commit, tree hash, approved plan hash, diff or
    test results — the §10.1 fields that say WHICH implementation is under

# capture already existed, so a failed capture killed the cycle. In practice
# that meant deleting evidence: the reply reached the file on the fourth
# attempt, two earlier attempts held seventy bytes of shell command and passed
# MC-2, and a better capture sat unnoticed in another directory. Nothing said
# which of them governed.
#
#     Use the rule that the first capture satisfying the predefined
#     capture-validity requirements becomes authoritative. Any replacement
#     requires explicit invalidation and preservation of both attempts.
#
# So attempts are numbered, all are kept, and one is designated. Nothing is
# deleted to tidy up, which is what happened three times in one afternoon.

"""Finding and state ledger.

Tracks every Codex finding through OPEN / RESOLVED / DISPUTED across the cycles
of one review loop, with a full audit trail and no illegal transitions.

    python scripts/ledger.py raise   --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --class "UNTESTED RULE" --requirement R-B7 --source CODEX_REVIEW
    python scripts/ledger.py respond --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --disposition ACCEPT --note "..."
    python scripts/ledger.py resolve --review <dir> --cycle 2 --id C01-F01 \
        --evidence "repaired in 02-PLAN.md §4"
    python scripts/ledger.py show    --review <dir> [--cycle N]

Exit 0 = done, 1 = refused, 2 = could not run.

The three states are the protocol's, §6: OPEN, RESOLVED, DISPUTED. There is no
fourth.

Why ACCEPT does not resolve
---------------------------
§5: on ACCEPT the finding's state becomes RESOLVED "once the repair is
demonstrated in the next review target". So accepting records a disposition and
leaves the state OPEN. Only a later cycle can move it to RESOLVED, and this
ledger refuses to do it in the same cycle as the ACCEPT.

That is not pedantry. If ACCEPT alone resolved a finding, the implementing agent
would close its own findings by asserting it intended to fix them, which is the
authority inversion MC-1 exists to prevent.

Who declares a repair demonstrated
----------------------------------
The protocol does not say mechanically, and this ledger does not invent an
answer. `resolve` requires an explicit evidence string and refuses without a
prior ACCEPT, so the assertion is recorded and attributable rather than implied.
See DECISIONS below.

DISPUTED is terminal here
-------------------------
§5 says a dispute "requires human adjudication" and §7.1 puts that at the human
gate. Nothing in the automated loop may move a finding out of DISPUTED, so this
ledger refuses. Adjudication belongs to the approval record, not here.

Invalid cycles do not authorize and do not block
------------------------------------------------
B01-F11. Transition authority is computed through `cycle_projection`, the same
module the loop controller uses, rather than from the stored state. An event
recorded in a cycle that fails MC-2 stays in the history as evidence and is
printed by `show`, but it cannot satisfy a precondition and it cannot stand in
the way of a valid transition. Before this, an ACCEPT in an invalid cycle could
authorize a closure and a DEMONSTRATED in an invalid cycle could prevent one
forever.

The stored `state` field is a cache of that projection, rewritten on every
command. Nothing reads it to decide anything.

# required to read, so the ledger was not a complete register of known defects.
#
# The alternative was letting the implementing agent raise findings against
# itself under reviewer identifiers, which would have made the ledger complete
# by making its provenance false. That is the worse trade: the review exists so

"""Loop-state controller.

Computes CONVERGED / HUMAN_ADJUDICATION_REQUIRED / STALLED / MAX_4_REACHED /
CONTINUE for one review loop, per §6 and §13 of the protocol, and shows the
working.

    python scripts/loop_state.py --review runs/A1E-001/plan-review

Exit 0 = a state was determined, 2 = could not run.
The state itself is on stdout as LOOP_STATUS; it is not an exit code, because
CONTINUE is not a failure and STALLED is not an error.

Validity is computed, not trusted
---------------------------------
§2 : "Only cycles that pass the MC-2 conformance gate count toward this maximum."
§3 : an invalid cycle "cannot support an authoritative Codex finding" and
     "cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles".

So this runs scripts/validate_cycle.py on every cycle directory rather than
reading a recorded verdict. A loop controller that accepted an asserted PASS
would let an invalid cycle consume the budget, which is the exact defect the
"MAX 4 counts valid cycles" note exists to prevent.

Two consequences, both deliberate and both worth disagreeing with if you see it
differently:

1. §6's n indexes VALID cycles, not directory numbers. If cycle-02 fails the
   gate, then cycle-03 is n=2. Otherwise |OPEN_n| would be compared against a
   cycle whose evidence is not authoritative.

2. Events recorded in an invalid cycle are ignored entirely, including
   resolutions. A finding accepted in valid cycle 1 and marked demonstrated in
   invalid cycle 2 stays OPEN, because the cycle that would demonstrate it
   cannot support an authoritative anything.

   What that establishes is narrow: the calculation excludes invalid-cycle
   events. This paragraph used to add that the exclusion "can only ever delay an
   exit, never manufacture one", and Codex refused the claim in cycle 03.
   Ignoring an invalid resolution does delay an exit. Ignoring an invalid RAISED
   or REOPENED removes an actionable finding, and a smaller OPEN set is how
   CONVERGED arrives early. The exclusion is not conservative in one direction,
   and calling it conservative made it sound safe in both.

What this does not do
---------------------
It does not decide whether a repair was demonstrated; the ledger records that
assertion and this reads it. It does not adjudicate disputes. And CONVERGED
here means the finding sets are empty, not that the plan is good.

    python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py check

Exit 0 = a bootstrap review exists, was approved, and still covers the code that
is actually on disk.
Exit 1 = it does not, and no real protocol cycle may run.
Exit 2 = could not run.

Why this exists
---------------
The orchestrator exists to constrain the implementing agent, and the implementing
agent wrote it. The MC-2 checker decides whether a cycle counts, and the same
agent wrote that too. Neither can go through the process it enables, because the
process does not exist until they do.

Alex Zamurko ruled on 8 September 2026:

    Make a one-time BOOTSTRAP_REVIEW mandatory before relying on those
    components for real protocol cycles. Preserve the exact bootstrap input, raw
    Codex output, findings, responses, and human decision.

So this is the one declared exception to the protocol, made explicit and made
enforceable rather than left as a paragraph someone remembers.

The part that is easy to get wrong
----------------------------------
A gate that only asks "did a bootstrap review happen" passes forever. The review
would authorise the code as it stood that day, the code would change the next
morning, and the gate would keep saying yes about a file that no longer exists in
the form anyone reviewed. That is the same defect as a green test pinned to a
superseded protocol, one level up.

So the decision record pins the sha256 of every component it covers, and `check`
re-hashes them. Editing a reviewed component invalidates the review, by design.
Re-reviewing is the cost of changing the thing that everything else trusts.

#     immediately after the first human approval of a runner ... without a precise

# The evidence schema is here because of B01-F10: the frozen review target
# carried six artifacts and the covered set held five. Codex was reviewing the
# schema, and editing it afterwards did not invalidate its own approval.
#
# It is not a script, and it implements no code, but MC-2 checks evidence
# against it. A gate that covers the checker and not the document the checker
# reads its expectations from has a seam running straight through the middle of

# not mean the edit is prevented, and it does not survive an edit that also
# disables the detection: replacing `evaluate` with an unconditional success
# defeats the self-hash along with everything else, because the same writable
# code performs both.
#
# An earlier comment here claimed self-hashing closed that hole. Codex raised it
# as B01-F15 and was right. Under CONVENTION_ONLY this is drift detection that
# holds when the checks run faithfully, and nothing stronger. The stronger claim
# needs a write boundary the implementing agent does not hold, which is what

    Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026:

        If validate_cycle.py or run_review.py imports repository-local modules
        whose changes can alter their behaviour, pinning only the two top-level
        files is insufficient. Either include those executable dependencies in
        the bootstrap decision hash set, or establish that the two files are
        behaviorally self-contained.

    They are not self-contained. run_review.py loads bootstrap_gate.py by path
    and invokes validate_cycle.py as a subprocess; loop_state.py invokes
    validate_cycle.py too. Editing a dependency changes a reviewed component's
    behaviour without changing its bytes, so a hash set of top-level files only
    is a hash set with a hole in it.

    Derived by walking references rather than listed by hand, because a
    hand-maintained dependency list is one that is right on the day it is written
    and silently wrong afterwards, which is the failure this whole gate exists to
    prevent one level down.

    Deliberately over-inclusive: a scripts/*.py named anywhere in a covered file,
    including in a usage line in its docstring, is treated as a dependency. The
    cost of over-inclusion is that an unrelated edit forces a re-review. The cost
    of under-inclusion is a component whose behaviour changed while its approval

    This is what makes the termination one-way, and it is the part that took a
    second look. A gate that decides by listing a directory can be reopened by
    deleting the directory: the exception would end and then quietly resume, and
    nothing in the tree would show it had ever ended. "Bootstrap" becoming an
    indefinite exemption is the exact failure ruling 2 exists to prevent, and
    deletion is the easiest route to it.

    Git history is the cheapest available record that a delete does not reach. It
    is not tamper-proof; a history rewrite defeats it. But a rewrite is a loud,
    deliberate act that leaves the reflog and every clone disagreeing, where
    deleting a file is neither.

    The asymmetry that makes this sound under MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY is
    worth stating. Nothing stops the implementing agent from WRITING an approval,
    but writing one only ever makes the rules stricter: it ends its own
    exemption and subjects every later runner to review by a prior approved one.
    The direction that would benefit the implementing agent is removing one, and
    that is the direction this closes.

    returns for a successful search that found nothing. So "no approval has ever
    been recorded" and "I could not find out" were indistinguishable, and the
    second one read as the first. Codex injected exit 128 and the exception came
    back available.

    That is the one-way termination failing open at exactly the point it is
    supposed to be hardest: an unreadable history is not evidence of absence,

"""The one parser for reviewer output, and the one Finding ID grammar.

Imported by the runner, which writes findings.json, and by the MC-2 checker,
which verifies it. One module rather than two implementations, because the
failure this closes is components each enforcing their own idea of the format.

Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026:

    Prompt, parser, and ledger must not independently impose different
    grammars. The clean choice is: the review format defines the canonical
    grammar, the runner validates it, and the ledger preserves it unchanged.

That happened. The prompt said `B01-F01`, the ledger demanded `C{cycle}-F{nn}`,
and eighteen findings were renamed between the review and the record. A second
copy of this logic anywhere would be a fourth grammar with the same problem, so
there is exactly one, and the grammar itself is read from the schema rather than
restated here.

"""What counts as a cycle, decided once and imported by everyone who asks.

B01-F11: "The ledger authorizes transitions from its unfiltered stored state and
history, while the controller filters events by valid cycles." Decision G was
implemented in `loop_state.py` alone, so the two components disagreed about what
a cycle is, and the disagreement was exploitable in both directions:

  * a DEMONSTRATED recorded in an invalid cycle left the ledger permanently
    RESOLVED, so a later valid resolution was refused while the controller still
    counted the finding OPEN. The finding could never be closed.
  * an ACCEPT recorded in an invalid cycle satisfied the ledger's precondition
    for `resolve`, so an invalid acceptance could authorize a closure the
    controller then counted as real.

Neither is fixable in one component. Filtering harder in the controller does not
stop the ledger from refusing; filtering harder in the ledger does not stop it
from authorizing. So the projection lives here, and both import it.

Three states, not two
--------------------
The distinction that makes this workable is between a cycle that has been judged
and failed and one that has not been judged yet.

    VALID     the directory exists and passes the MC-2 gate
    INVALID   the directory exists and fails it
    UNJUDGED  no directory yet

Only INVALID strips authority. An UNJUDGED cycle is the one being assembled
right now: findings get raised in it before its evidence is complete, and a
ledger that refused to record them would be unusable. Its events carry authority
provisionally, and lose it the moment the cycle is judged and fails, because
authority is recomputed on every read rather than frozen at write time.

Loop calculation is stricter and uses VALID only, per §2 and §3: an invalid cycle
"cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles", and an unjudged one has no
evidence to measure.

Nothing is ever deleted. Invalid events stay in the history as evidence of what
was recorded and when; they simply stop authorizing transitions and stop
blocking them.

        Two disqualifiers, not one.

        Judged-and-failed is the first: an invalid cycle cannot support an
        authoritative anything.

        The second is B01-F11's other half, which Codex found in cycle 02: this
        returned True for every cycle number absent from the invalid map,
        including cycles that do not exist. An event naming cycle 99 authorized
        transitions the loop controller would never count, because its
        arithmetic runs over cycles that exist. Beyond the horizon there is no
        cycle to have recorded anything.

        B01-F11 again, and the part cycle 03 found still open. The horizon rule
        above admitted every number up to max(known)+1, so an INTERIOR gap
        authorized: Projection([1, 3], {}) has horizon 4 and returned True for
        cycle 02, which never existed. Codex recorded RAISED in 01, ACCEPT in a
        nonexistent 02, and DEMONSTRATED in 03; the ledger reported RESOLVED
        while the controller, which counts only cycles that exist, kept the
        finding OPEN and returned STALLED. Two components disagreeing about one
        finding is the whole of B01-F11.

        What is closed here is the INTERIOR gap, which is what Codex
        reproduced. A cycle number below the frontier that is in neither the
        valid nor the invalid set has no evidence directory at all; it is not a
        cycle awaiting judgement, it is a cycle that never happened.

        What is deliberately NOT changed is the frontier, and the case where no
        cycle exists yet. Alex Zamurko's decision H:

            cycle_projection distinguishes three states, not two: VALID,
            INVALID and UNJUDGED. Only INVALID strips authority. A cycle with
            no directory yet is the one being assembled, and a ledger that
            refused to record into it would be unusable.

        Making UNJUDGED strip authority outright would close the rest of what
        Codex asked for and would contradict that decision, so it is his to
        make rather than one to take here while repairing a finding. The
        remaining exposure is stated in the cycle-04 prompt rather than left to
        be rediscovered: an event in the cycle currently being assembled carries
        authority before that cycle has passed MC-2.

    B01-F11, and the part cycle 02 found still broken. The first repair filtered
    which events were MEMBERS of the projection and then did `state =
    e["state"]` — it copied the state the event recorded. So a DEMONSTRATED in a
    valid cycle still produced RESOLVED even when the ACCEPT it depended on had
    been skipped for sitting in an invalid cycle. Codex reproduced it: RAISED in
    valid 01, ACCEPT in then-valid 02, DEMONSTRATED in valid 03; invalidate 02

"""Approvals that have to come from outside the implementing agent.

Alex Zamurko, 9 September 2026, ruling 3:

    An authoritative capture may be superseded only with explicit human/evidence
    authority approval and a recorded reason; the implementing agent cannot
    supersede it unilaterally ... allowing the implementing agent to choose a
    later Codex capture creates a direct cherry-picking path. Preserving all
    attempts is not sufficient if the same party can decide which one governs.

The same shape is needed for runner approval, which is what ends the bootstrap
exception, so it lives here once rather than being written twice and drifting.

What this establishes, and what it does not
-------------------------------------------
MC1_ENFORCEMENT is CONVENTION_ONLY on this environment. There is one machine and
one account, so nothing here proves who wrote a file. Saying otherwise would be
the "claim stronger than its evidence" failure the review prompt asks reviewers
to flag, and it would be this module claiming it.

What it does establish is narrower and still worth having:

  * an approval must exist as a separate artifact before the action runs, so the
    decision leaves a record instead of living in a command-line flag;
  * it must name a person and a reason, so the record is attributable;
  * it must bind to the exact bytes it approves, by hash, so an approval cannot
    be recycled for a different action later. This is the mechanical part, and
    it is the part that holds regardless of who wrote the file.

B02-F09: what this module used to claim
----------------------------------------
An earlier version of this docstring said the required hashes were "not knowable
until the action has been attempted and refused once", and concluded that
obtaining an approval was therefore a step outside the command. Codex checked it
in cycle 02 and it is false. Both values are ordinary facts available in advance:
the capture being displaced is named in capture-log.json as authoritative_sha256,
and the replacement is the sha256 of a file the caller already holds. The cycle
name is known too. No refusal is recorded anywhere and no nonce is involved, so a
valid approval can be written before any attempt is made. The probe that
demonstrated a successful supersession used exactly that construction.

Alex Zamurko, 10 September: "remove the claim that the external-authority step is
technically forced. Describe the current control as procedural / CONVENTION_ONLY,
and upgrade the claim only after a genuine independent write boundary exists."

So, stated at its real strength: this is a procedural control with deterministic
byte matching. It does not force a sequence, does not prove authorship, and does
not establish that the approval came from another actor. It requires the decision
to exist as a separate, attributable artifact bound to specific bytes. Under
CONVENTION_ONLY the implementing agent can write that artifact itself, and the
honest description of the difference is that doing so means composing a record in
someone else's name rather than passing a flag. How much that is worth depends on
the people involved, which is what "procedural" means. A write boundary would
make it structural, and needs a second machine.

"""Which artifacts govern a run, and which are under review. Never both.

Alex Zamurko, 10 September 2026, the Run-Pin and Review-Target Separation
Specification. Its governing invariant:

    No review process may require an artifact to remain byte-invariant for the
    duration of a run while simultaneously requiring that same artifact version
    to change in order to resolve review findings.

BOOTSTRAP-001 required exactly that. It pinned `specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md`
as its only run-level spec, and the same file was the first of cycle 01's six
review targets. Cycle 01 raised findings that could only be repaired by editing
it, and editing it broke the run's own pin, so the runner refused to open
cycle 02 — the cycle whose purpose was to demonstrate those repairs and move
eighteen findings out of OPEN. The loop was stopped by its own correctness.

Amendments are history, not edits
---------------------------------
run.json is evidence of what was pinned when the run was created, and it stays
true about that. Rewriting it so a failing check passes is the move this whole
repository exists to prevent, and it would destroy the only record of what
cycle 01 was actually conducted under.

So a change to the pin set is appended to `pin-amendments.json` instead, with
the five fields the specification requires: reason, affected artifacts, prior
pin set, new pin set, effective cycle. The pin set governing any cycle is then
computed by replaying that history rather than read from a single mutable field.

That matters beyond tidiness. Cycle 01 was conducted under the original pins and
cycle 02 under the amended ones, and both statements have to stay recoverable.
B01-F07, still open by Alex Zamurko's deferral, is the finding that no check ties
a cycle's recorded protocol_sha256 and spec_sha256 back to the run. When that is
repaired it must tie each cycle to the pins in force AT THAT CYCLE, which is what
`pins_for_cycle` returns. Tying every cycle to the latest pin set would
retroactively invalidate cycle 01, which is the same defect in a new place.

What this does not do
---------------------
It does not decide whether an amendment was wise. It records that one was made,
by whom, and why, and it refuses an amendment whose prior_pin_set does not match
what the history actually shows, so the chain cannot be quietly rewritten in the
middle. Under MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY that is drift detection, not
prevention.

    B02-F06, the half cycle 03 found still open. This used to take one review
    directory, and freeze handed it the directory it happened to be working in.
    The amendment history is a property of the whole run, so freezing
    implementation-review/cycle-01 never looked at plan-review/cycle-01. Codex
    froze a plan cycle under protocol plus spec, appended an amendment effective
    at cycle 1 removing the spec, froze the implementation cycle, and the
    implementation freeze exited 0. The earlier frozen assignment was never
    examined on that path.

    Each record keeps the review it came from. A map keyed by cycle number would
    let implementation-review/cycle-01 overwrite plan-review/cycle-01 and
    silently discard one of the two records this check exists to compare
    against — and those two are precisely the pair that disagree when an
    amendment has been backdated across loops.

    The recorded hashes come back as well as the paths. Cycles frozen before
    either field existed have neither, and are absent here rather than
    retro-checked: an amendment cannot be judged against a record nobody kept. A
    cycle that recorded paths but not hashes is checked on paths alone. Both
    gaps are real, they shrink as cycles accumulate, and saying otherwise would
    overstate what this establishes.

    increased. It said nothing about cycles that had already happened.

    The effective-cycle coordinate, written down because cycle 03 found it
    undefined across the two loops. `effective_cycle` is a RUN-level ordinal.
    Nothing in an amendment names a review type, and the history lives at the
    run root, so an amendment effective at cycle k governs cycle k onward in
    every review directory the run has. Reading it as "plan-review's cycle k"
    is what let the implementation loop freeze against a history contradicting a
    plan cycle already conducted. One consequence follows and is worth stating:
    two review directories that recorded different sets for the same cycle
    number cannot both be right, and at least one of them is refused here.

    Stated at its real strength: the frozen cycle records what governed it, and
    an amendment whose replay contradicts that record is refused. That is
    detection, and it holds while the checks run faithfully. It is not
