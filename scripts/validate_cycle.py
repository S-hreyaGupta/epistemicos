"""MC-2 conformance gate.

Checks one review cycle against specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md and MC-2 of the
protocol, which specifies fifteen checks: 1 to 10 for every cycle, and 11 to 15
additionally and unconditionally for implementation review cycles (§10.2).

    python scripts/validate_cycle.py runs/A1E-001/plan-review/cycle-01

Exit 0 = PASS, exit 1 = FAIL, exit 2 = the checker could not run.

A FAIL means REVIEW_CYCLE_STATUS = INVALID: the cycle cannot support a finding
and cannot count toward CONVERGED, STALLED, MAX_4_REACHED, or the four-cycle
budget. It is repaired and rerun, not interpreted.

Checks 11 to 15 apply only to implementation review. On a plan review they are
reported N/A rather than PASS. A check that reports success on a cycle it never
examined is the defect this gate exists to prevent, and it would be perverse to
build one into the gate itself.

Written under the anti-whitelist rule: every check derives its expectation from
the protocol text, and nothing passes because a previous run accepted it.

    """Check 9's governing digests, against the run rather than themselves.

    B01-F07, the half cycle 04 found still open. The previous version compared
    the target's assertions with each other: protocol_sha256 had to equal the
    recorded hash of SOME governing pin, and spec_sha256 had to be the digest
    over the rest. Codex wrote a target whose governing set was one file,
    `missing-protocol.md`, which does not exist, carrying the literal
    "not-a-hash", with protocol_sha256 set to the same string and spec_sha256
    set to the digest over the resulting empty remainder. Every comparison
    agreed. Check 9 passed and MC-2 returned PASS.

    Two separate things were wrong.

    Nothing validated the syntax, so a value that is not a digest at all was a
    usable digest. And which pin counted as the protocol was INFERRED from the
    field under test: the old `_owner` picked whichever entry's hash equalled
    protocol_sha256, so the check asked its answer to identify itself. An
    invented set satisfies both conditions as easily as a real one, which is
    why the existing controls stayed green — each changed one assertion and
    kept the other, and none made the whole set false together.

    The comment this replaces said that verifying against run.json and the
    amendment history "would make MC-2 depend on run-level state it does not
    currently read. That is a larger change than this finding, and it is not
    claimed here." Cycle 04 is the finding that says do it. The gate now reads
    the run's own record, replays the pin history for this cycle, and requires
    the recorded set to be the one the run actually produced. The protocol is
    the path the RUN declares, not the entry that happens to match.

    The syntax check below is not load-bearing and is not claimed to be. Any
    value that is not a digest also fails the identity or history comparison,
    because it cannot equal a real hash. It earns its place by failing early
    with a message that names the problem, rather than reporting a mismatch and
    leaving the reader to notice that one side was never a digest at all.

    Still not established, said plainly: this checks the digests against the
    run's history, not the bytes on disk against the digests. An artifact could
    be edited after freeze and both records would still agree. Under
    MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY that remains detection of record drift and
    is not a statement about the files.

    # B01-F07, the half cycle 03 found still open. The protocol's check 9 is

    # recorded hashes match the referenced artifacts". protocol_sha256 and
    # spec_sha256 are recorded hashes of referenced artifacts, and nothing
    # checked them: check 7 confirmed the fields EXIST and stopped. Codex set
    # both to the literal "not-a-hash", recomputed target.sha256, and the gate
    # returned PASS.
    #
    # Checked against governing_pin_hashes, which the same freeze recorded. What
    # that establishes and what it does not, stated plainly:
    #
    #   it catches a digest that is not a digest, and a digest edited to
    #   something other than what this cycle's pin set produces;
    #
    #   it does NOT independently establish that governing_pin_hashes is itself
    #   right, because both fields are written by one function in one moment.
    #   Doing that needs the gate to replay run.json and the amendment history,
    #   which would make MC-2 depend on run-level state it does not currently
    #   read. That is a larger change than this finding, and it is not claimed
    #   here.
    # Historical handling, which Codex asked for by name. governing_pins and
    # governing_pin_hashes arrived with B02-F06 on 11 September. BOOTSTRAP-001's
    # cycles 01 and 02 were frozen before that and carry neither. Failing them
    # now would invalidate two completed cycles, drop the valid-cycle count, and
    # strip authority from the events recorded in them — the retroactive
    # invalidation Alex Zamurko ruled out on 10 September, arriving through a
    # check rather than through an amendment.
    #
    # Both absent is the signature of evidence older than the field. One present
    # without the other is not old evidence, it is an incoherent record, and
    # that still fails.
    #
    # The weakness, stated rather than left to be found: deleting both fields
    # from a modern target buys a pass. This check cannot tell that from genuine
    # age, because nothing in the target says which version of the freezer wrote
    # it. Closing that needs the gate to know when the field was introduced, or
    # the target to record its own schema version, and neither exists yet.
