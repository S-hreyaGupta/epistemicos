"""Review cycle runner.

Composes review input, freezes the target, captures raw reviewer output, and
refuses to open a cycle whose preconditions do not hold.

    python scripts/run_review.py init   --run A1E-001 \
        --protocol specs/implementation-review-protocol-v1.1.md \
        --spec specs/gap/A1E_gap_object_schema_v1-4.md
    python scripts/run_review.py freeze --run A1E-001 --type plan \
        --prompt specs/prompts/plan-review.md --file runs/A1E-001/plan/01-PLAN.md
    python scripts/run_review.py record --cycle runs/A1E-001/plan-review/cycle-01 \
        --output raw.txt --invocation manual

Exit 0 = the step completed, 1 = refused, 2 = could not run.

MC-1 boundary, CONVENTION_ONLY on this environment
--------------------------------------------------
codex-input.md is composed here and never by the implementing agent. That
separation is a convention this script follows. It is not something the script
can enforce: the implementing agent holds write access to these paths. No claim
of technical protection may be made while MC1_ENFORCEMENT is CONVENTION_ONLY.

Write-once evidence
-------------------
target.json, target.sha256, codex-input.md and codex-output-raw.md are never
overwritten. A cycle that went wrong is repaired by opening a new cycle, not by
editing the old one. `freeze` refuses on an existing cycle directory; `record`
refuses when raw output is already present.

What this runner does not establish
-----------------------------------
It does not invoke the reviewer. It cannot show that codex-output-raw.md came
from the invocation codex-input.md describes; that binding rests on the operator
and is recorded, not proven, in invocation.json. This is the same limit stated
in specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md, restated here so it is visible at the point of
use.
