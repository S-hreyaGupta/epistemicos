"""Refresh the control counts the bootstrap prompts assert.

    python scripts/refresh_counts.py

Exit 0 = every suite ran to completion and the prompts now match.
Exit 1 = a suite did not exit cleanly; nothing was written.

Why this is a script and not a paste
------------------------------------
It was a here-string pasted into PowerShell, and on 12 September it recorded a
count from a suite that had crashed. `test_run_review.py` raised
FileNotFoundError two thirds of the way through, emitted 29 `[ok]` lines instead
of 95, and produced no FAIL line — so a grep for failures read clean. The
refresh then wrote 29 into both prompts, `test_prompts.py` compared 29 against
29 and passed, and the commit gate let it through.

Three separate checks agreed, and all three were measuring the same crash.

So: a suite that exits non-zero is not a measurement. Its count is whatever it
managed before dying, and writing that number into a document whose stated
purpose is to tell a reviewer how well controlled these components are would
understate them by two thirds. The prompt says it itself — "an inflated one
would misrepresent how well controlled these components are to the reviewer
being asked to trust them" — and the same is true of a deflated one.

Nothing is written unless every suite exits 0.

Why SUITES is five and not eight
--------------------------------
There are eight `test_*.py` files. Three are deliberately outside this count,
and the omission is written here rather than left to be inferred.

`test_prompts.py` is excluded because it is the consumer of this number. It
reads the counts these five produce and compares them against the prompts. A
suite that checked its own count would agree with itself, which is the defect
this script exists to prevent.

`test_convert_protocol.py` and `test_protocol_pin.py` are excluded because they
control protocol document handling — conversion fidelity, version pinning,
reference consistency — and none of those files are in the review target. The
number the prompts assert is a count of controls over the execution layer being
reviewed, not over the repository. Both were run by hand on 14 September and
both were green; they simply are not what this number measures.

If either ever covers a file in the review target, it belongs in SUITES.
