"""Negative controls for the bootstrap gate.

    python scripts/test_bootstrap_gate.py

Exit 0 = every refusal fired on a fixture built to produce it.

The gate is one boolean standing between development evidence and a real
protocol cycle, so the only thing that makes it worth having is that it can say
no. Each refusal below is demonstrated, and the approval path is demonstrated
too, because a gate that refuses everything is as useless as one that refuses
nothing.

The control that matters most is `approval does not survive editing a reviewed
component`. Without it the gate would answer "was there a review" rather than
"was this code reviewed", and it would keep saying yes about files nobody has
looked at since. That is the superseded-protocol-pin defect one level up.
