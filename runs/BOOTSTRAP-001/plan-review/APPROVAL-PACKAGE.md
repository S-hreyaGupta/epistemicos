# Human review package — BOOTSTRAP-001, plan review

Assembled by `scripts/approval_package.py` from the run's own records. Every figure below is quoted from the tool that owns it; none is recomputed here.

**This package decides nothing.** The decision is recorded separately, by a person, with `bootstrap_gate.py record`. §7.3 permits exactly three outcomes: `APPROVE`, `RETURN_FOR_REWORK`, `REJECT`.

## MC-1 enforcement status

`CONVENTION_ONLY`

Every check in this layer is detection that holds while the checks run faithfully and nobody edits the records they read. The same writable code performs the checks on itself. Nothing here is technically enforced.

Reconstructed rather than recorded at the time:

```text
{
  "added": "2026-09-11",
  "reconstructed": true,
  "why": "This run was created on 9 September, before cmd_init wrote mc1_enforcement. The field was absent and nothing required it when the run was consumed, which is B01-F14. It is added now so the requirement holds for every run rather than only for runs that already met it.",
  "basis": "CONVENTION_ONLY was the enforcement status on 9 September and has not changed since. One machine, one account, no write boundary. The value is reconstructed from that fact, not from a record kept at the time, because no such record was kept.",
  "authority": "Alex Zamurko, 10 September 2026: 'For BOOTSTRAP-001, record CONVENTION_ONLY as explicitly reconstructed metadata, not as if it had existed originally.'",
  "note": "Cycles 01 and 02 were frozen and reviewed while this field was absent. Adding it does not change what governed them and is not a claim that it was present at the time."
}
```

> **Development evidence, not a protocol outcome.** This run is marked `NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE`. Nothing in this package may be cited as a protocol result.

## Loop status and valid iteration count

The controller refuses to state an authoritative loop result for this run, and says why:

```text
REFUSED: BOOTSTRAP-001 is marked EXEMPT — BOOTSTRAP / DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE, NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE

  Its cycles are development evidence. A loop state computed over them is not a
  protocol outcome, and nothing in the output would have said so.

  Pass --development to compute it anyway. The result is labelled and must not be
  cited as an authoritative protocol result.
```

Recomputed with `--development`. The result is labelled and is not a protocol outcome:

```text
loop state — /sessions/elegant-wizardly-bardeen/mnt/epistemicos/runs/BOOTSTRAP-001/plan-review

DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE — NOT A PROTOCOL OUTCOME
  EXEMPT — BOOTSTRAP / DEVELOPMENT EVIDENCE, NOT_A_PROTOCOL_CYCLE
  The status below describes bootstrap evidence and does not establish a protocol
  result. §2 and §3 reserve authoritative outcomes to valid protocol cycles.

## Findings

§7.2 requires disputes and unresolved findings to be presented separately. They are separate headings below; the full ledger follows both.

### Unresolved findings — the human decides each one

§7.2: the human determines whether each requires correction, is explicitly waived or accepted, or causes rejection of the plan.

- **B01-F02** · CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING · S6
  - repair status: `IMPLEMENTED_AWAITING_DEMONSTRATION` — descriptive, not a lifecycle state

- **B02-F04** · CONTRADICTORY IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING
  - repair status: `IMPLEMENTED_AWAITING_DEMONSTRATION` — descriptive, not a lifecycle state
  - found by: `UNRECORDED`

### Disputes — the human adjudicates

§7.1: a dispute is a Codex finding plus a Claude `REJECT_WITH_REASON`.

None.

### Resolved findings

25 resolved.

`RESOLVED` under §5 means a repair was demonstrated in a later review target. It does not mean the repair was re-verified afterwards.

The gate is run now, against the frozen evidence, rather than quoted from a stored result. A recorded PASS is a claim about the past; this is the gate's answer today.

The bytes reviewed are preserved under `cycle-04/artifacts/`. They are what the reviewer saw, and they do not change when the working tree does.

## §7 coverage

Checked against §7's list rather than against what this package managed to produce, so an item that stopped being generated shows as absent instead of vanishing.

- [x] final plan
- [x] final plan hash
- [x] loop status
- [x] valid iteration count
- [ ] SPEC -> CODE -> TEST mapping
- [x] resolved findings
- [x] disputes
- [x] unresolved findings
- [x] MC-1 enforcement status
- [x] MC-2 conformance results for every valid cycle

**1 of 10 not present.**

- *SPEC -> CODE -> TEST mapping*: the output of a §1 plan audit. A bootstrap run reviews code directly and has no plan, so there is no mapping to produce. Named here rather than omitted, because a reviewer who cannot see what is missing cannot weigh it.

---

## Recording the decision

§7.3 permits `APPROVE`, `RETURN_FOR_REWORK`, `REJECT`. Nothing in this file records one.

```text
python scripts/bootstrap_gate.py record \
    --decision APPROVE|RETURN_FOR_REWORK|REJECT \
    --decided-by "<name>" \
    --note "<where the decision was made, and on what>"
```
