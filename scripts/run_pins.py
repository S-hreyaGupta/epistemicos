"""Which artifacts govern a run, and which are under review. Never both.

Alex Zamurko, 10 September 2026, the Run-Pin and Review-Target Separation
Specification. Its governing invariant:

    No review process may require an artifact to remain byte-invariant for the
    duration of a run while simultaneously requiring that same artifact version
    to change in order to resolve review findings.

BOOTSTRAP-001 required exactly that. It pinned `specs/evidence-schema-v1.0.md`
as its only run-level spec, and the same file was the first of cycle 01's six
review targets. Cycle 01 raised findings that could only be repaired by editing
it, and editing it broke the run's own pin, so the runner refused to open
cycle 02 — the cycle whose purpose was to demonstrate those repairs and move
eighteen findings out of OPEN. The loop was stopped by its own correctness.

Amendments are history, not edits
---------------------------------
run.json is evidence of what was pinned when the run was created, and it stays
true about that. Rewriting it so a failing check passes is the move this whole
repository exists to prevent, and it would destroy the only record of what
cycle 01 was actually conducted under.

So a change to the pin set is appended to `pin-amendments.json` instead, with
the five fields the specification requires: reason, affected artifacts, prior
pin set, new pin set, effective cycle. The pin set governing any cycle is then
computed by replaying that history rather than read from a single mutable field.

That matters beyond tidiness. Cycle 01 was conducted under the original pins and
cycle 02 under the amended ones, and both statements have to stay recoverable.
B01-F07, still open by Alex Zamurko's deferral, is the finding that no check ties
a cycle's recorded protocol_sha256 and spec_sha256 back to the run. When that is
repaired it must tie each cycle to the pins in force AT THAT CYCLE, which is what
`pins_for_cycle` returns. Tying every cycle to the latest pin set would
retroactively invalidate cycle 01, which is the same defect in a new place.

What this does not do
---------------------
It does not decide whether an amendment was wise. It records that one was made,
by whom, and why, and it refuses an amendment whose prior_pin_set does not match
what the history actually shows, so the chain cannot be quietly rewritten in the
middle. Under MC1_ENFORCEMENT: CONVENTION_ONLY that is drift detection, not
prevention.
