"""Finding and state ledger.

Tracks every Codex finding through OPEN / RESOLVED / DISPUTED across the cycles
of one review loop, with a full audit trail and no illegal transitions.

    python scripts/ledger.py raise   --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --class "UNTESTED RULE" --requirement R-B7 --source CODEX_REVIEW
    python scripts/ledger.py respond --review <dir> --cycle 1 --id C01-F01 \
        --disposition ACCEPT --note "..."
    python scripts/ledger.py resolve --review <dir> --cycle 2 --id C01-F01 \
        --evidence "repaired in 02-PLAN.md §4"
    python scripts/ledger.py show    --review <dir> [--cycle N]

Exit 0 = done, 1 = refused, 2 = could not run.

The three states are the protocol's, §6: OPEN, RESOLVED, DISPUTED. There is no
fourth.

Why ACCEPT does not resolve
---------------------------
§5: on ACCEPT the finding's state becomes RESOLVED "once the repair is
demonstrated in the next review target". So accepting records a disposition and
leaves the state OPEN. Only a later cycle can move it to RESOLVED, and this
ledger refuses to do it in the same cycle as the ACCEPT.

That is not pedantry. If ACCEPT alone resolved a finding, the implementing agent
would close its own findings by asserting it intended to fix them, which is the
authority inversion MC-1 exists to prevent.

Who declares a repair demonstrated
----------------------------------
The protocol does not say mechanically, and this ledger does not invent an
answer. `resolve` requires an explicit evidence string and refuses without a
prior ACCEPT, so the assertion is recorded and attributable rather than implied.
See DECISIONS below.

DISPUTED is terminal here
-------------------------
§5 says a dispute "requires human adjudication" and §7.1 puts that at the human
gate. Nothing in the automated loop may move a finding out of DISPUTED, so this
ledger refuses. Adjudication belongs to the approval record, not here.

Invalid cycles do not authorize and do not block
------------------------------------------------
B01-F11. Transition authority is computed through `cycle_projection`, the same
module the loop controller uses, rather than from the stored state. An event
recorded in a cycle that fails MC-2 stays in the history as evidence and is
printed by `show`, but it cannot satisfy a precondition and it cannot stand in
the way of a valid transition. Before this, an ACCEPT in an invalid cycle could
authorize a closure and a DEMONSTRATED in an invalid cycle could prevent one
forever.

The stored `state` field is a cache of that projection, rewritten on every
command. Nothing reads it to decide anything.

# the schema's FINDING_ID_GRAMMAR allows up to two. So `AB02-F01` parsed cleanly
# and the ledger then refused it, and a finding that was valid at capture could

# purpose is to stop there being more than one.
#
# Alex Zamurko, 9 September: "Prompt, parser, and ledger must not independently
# impose different grammars." And 10 September: "Have the ledger consume the
# canonical grammar and preserve every valid identifier. Keep any origin-cycle
# validation separate from prefix-length assumptions."
#
# Which is why the local copy existed at all: the ledger needed a capture group
# for the cycle digits, and the canonical pattern has none. The two jobs are now
# separate. Validity is the schema's question; the cycle digits are found by
# their position relative to the -F, which holds for any prefix length.

# B02-F11 was open from 10 September and had two instances by the time it was

# finished cycles' prompts on 15 September. Both sat in prose nobody was
# required to read, so the ledger was not a complete register of known defects.
#
# The alternative was letting the implementing agent raise findings against
# itself under reviewer identifiers, which would have made the ledger complete
# by making its provenance false. That is the worse trade: the review exists so
# as not to depend on the implementer's own account of its work, and an

        RESOLVED -> OPEN. The recurrence is recorded as a reopen event with

    Before this the ledger refused outright, which was wrong in both directions:
    a recurrence either had to be recorded under a new identifier, breaking V40
    and §6's re-raise detection, or not recorded at all. There is still no fourth
