"""What counts as a cycle, decided once and imported by everyone who asks.

B01-F11: "The ledger authorizes transitions from its unfiltered stored state and
history, while the controller filters events by valid cycles." Decision G was
implemented in `loop_state.py` alone, so the two components disagreed about what
a cycle is, and the disagreement was exploitable in both directions:

  * a DEMONSTRATED recorded in an invalid cycle left the ledger permanently
    RESOLVED, so a later valid resolution was refused while the controller still
    counted the finding OPEN. The finding could never be closed.
  * an ACCEPT recorded in an invalid cycle satisfied the ledger's precondition
    for `resolve`, so an invalid acceptance could authorize a closure the
    controller then counted as real.

Neither is fixable in one component. Filtering harder in the controller does not
stop the ledger from refusing; filtering harder in the ledger does not stop it
from authorizing. So the projection lives here, and both import it.

Three states, not two
--------------------
The distinction that makes this workable is between a cycle that has been judged
and failed and one that has not been judged yet.

    VALID     the directory exists and passes the MC-2 gate
    INVALID   the directory exists and fails it
    UNJUDGED  no directory yet

Only INVALID strips authority. An UNJUDGED cycle is the one being assembled
right now: findings get raised in it before its evidence is complete, and a
ledger that refused to record them would be unusable. Its events carry authority
provisionally, and lose it the moment the cycle is judged and fails, because
authority is recomputed on every read rather than frozen at write time.

Loop calculation is stricter and uses VALID only, per §2 and §3: an invalid cycle
"cannot consume one of the four valid review cycles", and an unjudged one has no
evidence to measure.

Nothing is ever deleted. Invalid events stay in the history as evidence of what
was recorded and when; they simply stop authorizing transitions and stop
blocking them.

        Two disqualifiers, not one.

        Judged-and-failed is the first: an invalid cycle cannot support an
        authoritative anything.

        The second is B01-F11's other half, which Codex found in cycle 02: this
        returned True for every cycle number absent from the invalid map,
        including cycles that do not exist. An event naming cycle 99 authorized
        transitions the loop controller would never count, because its
        arithmetic runs over cycles that exist. Beyond the horizon there is no
        cycle to have recorded anything.

        B01-F11 again, and the part cycle 03 found still open. The horizon rule
        above admitted every number up to max(known)+1, so an INTERIOR gap
        authorized: Projection([1, 3], {}) has horizon 4 and returned True for
        cycle 02, which never existed. Codex recorded RAISED in 01, ACCEPT in a
        nonexistent 02, and DEMONSTRATED in 03; the ledger reported RESOLVED
        while the controller, which counts only cycles that exist, kept the
        finding OPEN and returned STALLED. Two components disagreeing about one
        finding is the whole of B01-F11.

        What is closed here is the INTERIOR gap, which is what Codex
        reproduced. A cycle number below the frontier that is in neither the
        valid nor the invalid set has no evidence directory at all; it is not a
        cycle awaiting judgement, it is a cycle that never happened.

        What is deliberately NOT changed is the frontier, and the case where no
        cycle exists yet. Alex Zamurko's decision H:

            cycle_projection distinguishes three states, not two: VALID,
            INVALID and UNJUDGED. Only INVALID strips authority. A cycle with
            no directory yet is the one being assembled, and a ledger that
            refused to record into it would be unusable.

        Making UNJUDGED strip authority outright would close the rest of what
        Codex asked for and would contradict that decision, so it is his to
        make rather than one to take here while repairing a finding. The
        remaining exposure is stated in the cycle-04 prompt rather than left to
        be rediscovered: an event in the cycle currently being assembled carries
        authority before that cycle has passed MC-2.
